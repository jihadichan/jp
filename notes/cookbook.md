### How to move vocab deck contents

Let's say you want to archive `vocab2`.

1. Export notes, include all
2. Open in Excel
3. Copy complete column with images (`<img src="yomichan_...`) and replace `yomichan_` with `vocab2/yomichan_`
4. Same for `[sound:yomichan_` column.
5. Copy all image & mp3 files from `/.local/share/Anki2/User 1/collection.media`, into new folder `vocab2`
6. Reimporting, don't forget to set to "update" and allow HTML

Don't forget to set your new deck in the AnkiConnect settings in Yomichan.



## YomiChan



### Overwrite KanjiDict

1. Export kanji decks. 
   - Names must match `^UberKanji.*\.txt$`
   - Put into `/uberkanji/yomichan/deck`
2. Either leave existing KanjiDict in `/uberkanji/yomichan/dict` as it is (should be alright). Or download clean version from [website](https://foosoft.net/projects/yomichan/).
3. Run `/uberkanji/src/main/java/yomichan/_UpdateDictForYomichan.java`
4. `cp output.json kanji_bank_1.json` (in `/uberkanji/yomichan/dict`), remove all other files like `kanji_bank_*`. Output contains all entries.
5. Zip all left-over JSON files to `kanjidic_english.zip`
6. Import in Yomichan (delete `KANJIDIC (English) rev.kanjidic2` beforehand)
7. Works immediately, no browser restart needed
