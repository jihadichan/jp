# Conjugations

## Conjugation building blocks

- Noun & na-adjectives conjugations are simply conjugations of だ

- i-adjective conjugations are a mix of conjugations from だ　＆　ある

- Verb stems are based on their dictionary form ending, where the vowel is changed in some way.

**だ** - to be, is - verb, copula

A copula is a word meaning “to be”, and is used to predicate a sentence, giving the subject identity, properties, state, or membership in a group. Unlike in English, however, the Japanese copula can’t be used to show existence – instead you must use the verbs いる (iru) for animate beings and ある (aru) for inanimate objects. 

- The verb だ is a contraction of the である
- In the negative forms, じゃ is a colloquial contraction of では. Used in formal documents.
- Replacing じゃありません with じゃないです expresses a stronger negation. Also more colloquial.
- The attributive form of the copula is である, but the particles の and な are generally used instead. This の is the familiar [modifying particle](http://www.japaneseprofessor.com/lessons/beginning/modifying-particle-no/), but in some cases な is used instead (such as the “explaining” construction *na no da/desu*).
- た (not だ) indicates past, i.e. "did", "have done"

| Type                | Plain         | Polite                         | Honorific              |
| ------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Present Affirmative | だ            | です                           | でございます           |
| Past Affirmative    | だった        | でした                         | でございました         |
| Present Negative    | じゃない      | じゃありません<br>じゃないです | ではございません       |
| Past Negative       | じゃなかった  | じゃありませんでした           | ではございませんでした |
| Volitional          | だろう        | でしょう                       | でございましょう       |
| Te-Form             | で            | でありまして                   | でございまして         |
| Conditional         | なら / ならば | であれば                       | であれば               |
| Attributive         | の/な         |                                |                        |

# Particles

| Particle | Explanation                                                  |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|で|- Marks a place, area, or length of time inside which something occurs.<br>- Marks a method, tool or circumstance under which something happens.<br>- Marks a material or substance; composition.<br>- See also "connecting sentences"|
|でも|- Conjunction, equal to "but", "however"<br>- After question word (誰, 何, どこ, etc) it turns them into "unspecific qualifiers", like "any". E.g. 誰でも (anybody), 何でも (anything), いつでも (anytime)|
| は       | - Topic particle (identifies what it is that you’re talking about)<br>- Contrasts one option or thing against others. (A vs. B, C, D)<br>- Used when elaborating on things already known to the listener.<br>- って is often used in place of the 「は」 particle to simply bring up a topic. |
|へ|- Indicates direction or goal (e.g. "to")pronounced え in modern Japanese|
|か|- Question marker in polite speech, i.e. '?'. Can also occur as *か*よ、like '?!'<br>- Attached to the end of a relative clause makes a mini-question inside a larger sentence. E.g. 昨日何を食べたか忘れた - "Forgot what I ate yesterday"<br>- After question word (誰, 何, どこ, etc) it turns them into "unspecific qualifiers", like "some".  E.g. 誰か (somewhere)、何か (something), どこか (somewhere), etc.|
|が|- Identifier particle (also called subject particle), identifies the topic<br>- Distinguishes one option or thing from others. (A vs. ???)<br>- Used when adding new things/information to a conversation.<br>- Used when describing specific things with adjectives.<br>- Marks objects of potential-form verbs. (can/able to)<br>- See also "connecting sentences"|
| も       | - Inclusive / exclusive topic particle (i.e. "also" or "not, neither" with negation)<br>- After question word (誰, 何, どこ, etc) it turns them into "unspecific qualifiers" (see か),<br>Can mostly also be negated E.g. 誰も (Everybody/Nobody), 何も (Nothing - negative only)<br>- When the 「も」 particle comes after some type of amount, it means that the amount indicated is way too much.<br>- も softens the statement. 「そんなこと**も**ない」 sounds softer and less decisive/assertive than 「そんなこと**は**ない」. |
|ん|- Can be short form for  の|
|な|- You can use 「な」 in place of 「ね」 when it sounds too soft and reserved for what you want to say<br>- The 「な」 sentence-ending particle is often used with the question marker 「か」 to indicate that the speaker is considering something.<br>今日は雨が降るかな？<br>I wonder if it’ll rain today.|
|ね|- At sentence end, equivalent to “right?”, “isn’t it?”. Same as German "... ne?"|
|に|- The "target particle"<br>- Marks an indirect object (the person/thing an action is done for/directed toward)<br>- Marks a destination, direction or specific place for an action. (to/at)<br/>- Marks a specific point in time (ie. Monday / 3pm / 1972 / July)<br>- Marks a period of time that something repeats in.<br>- Marks direct objects for: なる (to become), あう (to meet), のる (to ride)<br>- The idea of a target in Japanese is very general and is not restricted to motion verbs. The location of an object can be defined as the target of the verb for existence （にある and にいる）|
| の | - Possessive particle. Connects nouns: AのB = "A's B" or "B of A". E.g.<br>アメリカの大学  = College of America.<br>- Can replace a noun, e.g. 白いのは... - white thing is... - Equivalent to 物 (こと)<br>- Nominalizer for verbs and adjectives. Like -ING in English. E.g. 勉強するの - studyING<br>- Indicates explanation or need for one (i.e. "Look, here’s the reason"), when used as sentence ending. Also ん, のだ or んだ. And *な*のだ or なんだ needed for differentiation. ジムのだ (It is Jim’s) vs ジムなのだ (It is Jim). The だ can also be conjugated<br>E.g. のじゃない、 んじゃなかった、etc<br>- See also の Adjectives<br>- Short form is often ん |
|さ|- Basically a very casual form of 「よ」, is similar to the English “like” in that some people throw it in at the end of almost every single phrase.|
| と | - Marks a person that an action is done with.<br>- Links nouns to create a complete “and” group.<br>- Marks quoted speech or phrasal objects: おもう (to think), かく (to write)<br>- Shows a natural/predictable “if-then” relationship between clauses.<br>- Marks onomatopoeic words. |
| を | - Marks the grammatical object of a sentence, i.e. direct object marker of an action. It follows nouns and noun phrases.<br>- With verbs of motion, shows where the motion occurs.<br>- Partly used for suru-verbs |
|わ|- Using「わ」 is just like 「よ」 except it will make you sound almost sickeningly female (putting different dialects aside).|
| よ | - At sentence end, informing the listener of something new or emphasis. Like "you know". Also as よね |



# Unsorted Grammar Points

| Grammar Point&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | Explanation                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Sentence order                                               | Only rule is that the verb comes at the end. The subject and object can be shifted however you want. |
| Adjectives to adverbs                                        | i-adjectives: 早い → 早く、na-adjectives: きれい → きれいに<br>E.g. 早く食べた - quickly ate |
| Verb + motion verb                                           | Frm: [verb with masu-stem] + [maybe a particle] + 行く OR 来る.<br>E.g. 見に行く - "go to see"<br>Can also be conjugated: 遊びにきた - "came to play"、持っていって - "go and bring" |
| どうか                                                       | どう + か - when used in an "implicit question" (see か particle) it's roughly equivalent to saying “whether or not” |
| Potential form exceptions                                    | Use 見える and 聞こえる when you want to say that you can see or hear something. If however, you wanted to say that you were given the opportunity to see or hear something, you would use the regular potential form. |
| 〜にする                                                     | に + する means “to decide on [X]”.                          |
| 〜なる                                                       | - When using with nouns and na-adjectives use with に, i.e. 〜になる<br>- When using 〜なる with i-adjectives, instead of using ~になる, you need to conjugate the adjective to its negative stem and then attach なる. E.g. 強くなる (become strong), 強くなかった (was not strong), 強くなった (became strong(er))<br>- When using with verbs add a generic noun such as a generic event: こと (事) or an appearance/manner: よう (様） |
| Transitive / Intransitive&nbsp;Verbs                         | The difference between the two is that transitive verbs is an action done by an active agent while intransitive verbs are used when something occurs without a direct agent. |
| 欲しい<br>ほしい                                             | - Want to.<br>- Works like 好き.<br>- When combined with the te-form of a verb, it means “to want something done” |
| だい？<br>かい？                                             | - 「かい」 and 「だい」 are strongly masculine sentence endings for asking questions. 「かい」 is used for yes/no questions while 「だい」 is used for open-ended questions. |
| Gender-specific particles                                    | - Using 「わ」 is just like 「よ」 except it will make you sound very feminine<br>-「かしら」 is also a very feminine version of 「かな」(see な particle)<br>-「ぞ」 and 「ぜ」 are identical to 「よ」 except that it makes you sound “cool” and manly |
| Humble Form                                                  | Humble Conjugation: お + stem + する<br>先生、お聞きしたいことがありますが。<br/>Teacher, there’s something I want to ask you. |
| しまう                                                       | - Express an action that has taken place unintentionally often with unsatisfactory results, i.e. "dang it..."<br>しまった！<br>Oh no! (I screwed up!)<br>- Express an action that is done or happened unintentionally.<br>Te-form of verb + しまう<br>毎日ケーキを食べて、２キロ太ってしまいました。<br>I ate cake everyday and I (unintentionally) gained two kilograms.<br>- In casual speech, the 「～てしまう」 is often substituted by 「～ちゃう」 while 「～でしまう」 is substituted by 「じゃう」. Both 「～ちゃう」 and 「～じゃう」 conjugate just like regular u-verbs.<br>- Occasionally but not usually, 「しまう」 will have the meaning “to finish something completely” rather than the unintended action. |
| こと...ある                                                  | - When you combine 「こと」, the generic word for an event with 「ある」, you can talk about whether an event exists or not.<br>- E.g. ことはある、ことはありません、ことがある、ことない、こともない |
| ところ                                                       | - 「ところ」（所） is usually used to indicate a generic physical location. However, it can also hold a much broader meaning ranging from a characteristic to a place in time. |
| もの                                                         | - The generic object noun 「もの」 can be used as a casual and feminine way of emphasizing something. This is identical to the explanatory feminine emphasis expressed by the 「の」 particle. Just like the explanatory 「の」 particle, the 「の」 is often changed into 「ん」 resulting in 「もん」. |
| かもしれない<br>かも知れない                                 | - 「かもしれない」 is used to mean “maybe” or “possibly” and is less certain than the word 「多分」. It attaches to the end of a complete clause.<br>- For noun and na-adjective clauses, the declarative 「だ」 must be removed.<br>- The conjugation base is 知れる<br>- It can be abbreviated to just 「かも」 in casual speech. |
| でしょう                                                     | - 「でしょう」 is used to express a level of some certainty and is close in meaning to 「多分」. Just like 「～です／～ます」, it must come at the end of a complete sentence. It does not have any other conjugations.<br>- It's the polite volitional form of だ. And だろうis the plain form.<br>- You can also replace 「～ですか」 with 「～でしょうか」<br>- In casual speech it can be shortened to 「でしょ」. The casual version has a much stronger flavor often sounding more like, “See, I told you so!”<br>だから、時間がないって言ったでしょう！<br>That’s why I told you there was no time! |
| わけ                                                         | - Used to express a conclusion. <br>つまり、語学には、能力がないという訳か。<br>Jim: So basically, it *means* that you don’t have ability at language.<br>中国語が読めるわけがない。<br>There’s no way I can read Chinese. (lit: There is no reasoning for [me] to be able to read Chinese.)<br>- When using with ない the particle can be dropped, i.e. ～わけない instead of 〜わけがない<br>- Can also mean that something is very easy (lit: requires no explanation). |
| とする                                                       | - Used for making hypotheses, e.g. assume, suppose<br>- 「とする」 is really just a combination of the quotation particle 「と」 and the verb 「する」 meaning “to do”.<br>- [verb]とする. This means literally that you are doing like “[verb]” (in quotes). When used with the volitional, it becomes: “Doing like making motion to do [verb]”. In other words, you are acting as if to make a motion to do [verb].<br>明日に行くとする。<br>Assume we go tomorrow.<br>- Note that conjugations happen with する, i.e. are irregular and not easy to recognize as such. E.g.  としたら is する in past form with the conditional たら ending. |
| ～ばかり                                                     | - Indicate that one has just finished doing something<br>- Take the past tense of verb that you want to indicate as just being completed and add 「ばかり」. This is used with only the past tense of verbs and is not to be confused with the 「ばかり」 used with nouns to express amounts.<br>- In slang you can hear people use 「ばっか」 instead of 「ばかり」.<br>すみません、今食べたばかりなので、お腹がいっぱいです。<br>Sorry, but I’m full having just eaten. |
| 〜とたん                                                     | - Kind of as a supplement to 「ばかり」, we will cover one way to say something happened as soon as something else occurs. To use this grammar, add 「とたん」 to the past tense of the first action that happened. It is also common to add the 「に」 target particle to indicate that specific point in time.<br>窓を開けたとたんに、猫が跳んでいった。<br>As soon as I opened window, cat jumped out. |
| 〜ながら                                                     | - Used to express that one action is taking place in conjunction with another action.<br>- masu-stem + ながら<br>テレビを観ながら、宿題をする。<br>Do homework while watching TV.<br>- Used it with nouns or adjectives to talk about what something is while something else, i.e. “While it’s unfortunate, something something…”. As ながらも changes the meaning from “while” to “even while”.<br>貧乏ながらも、高級なバッグを買っちゃったよ。<br>Even while I’m poor, I ended up buying a high quality bag. |
| 〜まくる                                                     | - Verb suffix to indicate doing something with "reckless abandon to the activity", i.e. to do relentlessly or "all the time"<br>- masu-stem + まくる<br>やりまくっている - doing all the time<br>やりまくっていない - don’t do all the time<br>やりまくっていた - did all the time<br>やりまくっていなかった - didn’t do all the time |
| ～やすい<br>～にくい                                         | - To describe an action as being easy, change the verb to the masu stem and add 「やすい」. To describe an action as being difficult, attach 「にくい」 to the stem.<br>しゃべる → しゃべり → しゃべりにくい<br>食べにくい<br>食べにくくない<br>食べにくかった<br>食べにくくなかった<br>この字は読みにくい<br>This hand-writing is hard to read. |
| ～がたい<br>～づらい                                         | - The kanji for 「にくい」 actually comes from 「難い」 which can also be read as 「かたい」. As a result, you can also add a voiced version 「～がたい」 as a verb suffix to express the same thing as 「にくい」. Yet another, more coarse variation of stem + 「にくい」 is to use 「づらい」 instead which is a slightly transformed version of 「辛い」（つらい）. This is not to be confused with the same 「辛い」（からい）, which means spicy! |
| まま                                                         | - Grammatical phrase to express a lack of change in something, e.g. "the way it is" Grammatically, it is used just like a regular noun.<br>このままで宜しいですか？<br>Is it ok just like this? |
| 〜っぱなし<br>〜っ放し                                       | - The verb 「放す」 meaning “to set loose”, can be used in various ways in regards to leaving something the way it is. For instance, a variation 「放っとく」 is used when you want to say “Leave me alone”.<br>- As suffix you can attach it to the masu stem of any verb to describe the act of doing something and leaving it that way without changing it. You can treat the combination like a regular noun. The suffix carries a nuance that the thing left alone is due to oversight or neglect. |
| である                                                       | - 「である」 is another type of state-of-being that is primarily used to state facts in a neutral, official sounding manner. だ is the contraction of である. Works like using だ and です.<br>- The negative is ではない (colloquial じゃない、じゃ is a colloquial contraction of では)<br>学生である - is student<br>学生ではない - is not student<br>学生であった	- was student<br>学生ではなかった	- was not student |
| ～がる                                                       | - Used when you want to make an observation about how someone is feeling. Therefore, you would not use it for your own emotions since guessing about your own emotions is not necessary.<br>- Can only be used with adjectives<br>For i-adjectives: 怖い → 怖がる<br>For na-adjectives: 嫌 → 嫌がる |
| 〜ばかり                                                     | - Like ～がる but for verbs. <br>For present, non-negative: Conjugate the verb to the 「ん」 negative form and attach 「ばかり」: <br>言う → 言わない → 言わん → 言わんばかり<br>For all other tenses: Attach 「ばかり」 to the end of the verb: <br>言わなかった → 言わなかったばかり |
| 〜めく                                                       | - Used to indicate that something is showing the signs of a certain state. Unlike the 「～がる」 grammar, there is no action that indicates anything; merely the atmosphere gives off the impression of the state.<br>- This grammar is used by simply attaching 「めく」 to the noun or na-adjective. Conjugations on the suffix work then like on a -ku verb |
| ～ざるを得ない                                               | - Used when there’s something that just can’t be helped and must be done. It uses the negative of the verb 「得る」 or “obtain”, to roughly mean that “one cannot obtain not doing of an action”.<br>- To say that you can’t not do something replace the 「ない」 part of the negative verb with 「ざる」, then attach 「を得ない」 to the end of the verb.<br>食る → 食べない → 食べざる → 食べざるを得ない<br>行く → 行かない → 行かざる → 行かざるを得ない<br>する → せざる → せざるをえない<br>くる → こざる → こざるをえない |
| やむを得ない                                                 | - This grammar is very similar to the one we just learned above except that it uses the verb 「止む」 to say that one cannot obtain the stopping of something. It is used to describe something that one is forced to do due to some circumstances. The difference here is that this is a complete phrase, which can be used for a general situation that doesn’t involve any specific action. In other words, you’re not actually forced to *do* something; rather it describes a situation that cannot be helped. If you have already learned 「仕方がない」 or 「しょうがない」, this grammar means pretty much the same thing. |
| ～かねる                                                     | - 「かねる」 is a ru-verb that is used as a suffix to other verbs to express a person’s inability, reluctance, or refusal to do something. It is often used in the negative as 「かねない」 to indicate that there is a possibility that the verb in question might happen.<br>- To say that something cannot be done using 「かねる」, change the verb to the masu stem and attach 「かねる」. |
| ～がち                                                       | - Say that something is likely to occur. In other words, the result becomes a description of something as being likely.<br>- For verbs: Attach 「がち」 to the stem of the verb.<br>- For nouns: Attach 「がち」 to the appropriate noun<br>- All adjectives that are conjugated with 「～がち」 become a noun/na-adjective (it itself is a na-adjective). |
| ～つつ                                                       | - 「つつ」 is a verb modifier that can be attached to the masu stem of verbs to express an ongoing occurrence. There are 2 ways to use this grammar point: <br>1. The first is almost identical to the 「～ながら」 grammar.<br>2. The second way to use this grammar is to express the existence of a continuing process by using 「ある」, the verb for existence. Everything is the same as before except that you attach 「ある」 to 「つつ」 to produce 「～つつある」. |
| きらいがある                                                 | -「きらいがある」 is a fixed expression used to describe a bad tendency or habit. I suspect that 「きらい」 here *might* have something to do with the word for hateful: 「嫌い」. The 「きらい」 in this grammar functions as a noun. 「ある」 is simply the existence verb for inanimate objects. |
| だらけ                                                       | - 「だらけ」 is usually used when something is riddled everywhere. It generally carries a negative connotation. There is no conjugation rule to cover here, all you need to do is attach 「だらけ」 to the noun that is just all over the place.<br>間違い → 間違いだらけ (riddled with mistakes)<br>埃 → 埃だらけ (riddled with dust) |
| まみれ                                                       | - 「まみれ」 may seem very similar to 「だらけ」 but there are some very important subtle differences. It’s only used for actually physical objects so you can’t say "riddled with mistakes" (see だらけ). Plus, you can only use it for things that literally cover the object. So you can use it for things like liquids and dust, but you can’t use it for things like scratches and garbage.<br>- The grammatical rules are the same as 「だらけ」. |
| ずくめ                                                       | - ずくめ」 describes something that applies to the whole thing. For instance, if we were talking about the human body, the expression “is [X] from head to toe” might be close to what 「ずくめ」 means. Usually used with a color to describe people completely dressed in that color.<br>- Grammatically, 「ずくめ」 works in exactly the same ways as 「だらけ」 and 「まみれ」. |
| が早いか                                                     | - Used to describe something that happened the instant something else occurred<br>- You attach 「が早いか」 to the first verb, then you describe the event that happened the next instant. The curious thing about this grammar is that the 「が」 particle comes right after the verb. Remember, you can do this *only* with this specific grammatical phrase.<br>言う → 言うが早いか<br>言う → 言った → 言ったが早いか |
| や・や否や                                                   | - The 「や」 or 「や否や」（やいなや） phrase, when appended to a verb, is used to described something that happened right after that verb. Its meaning is essential the same as 「が早いか」.<br>- You can use this grammar by attaching 「や」 or 「や否や」 to the dictionary form of the first verb that occurred.<br>見る → 見るや<br>見る → 見るや否や |
| そばから                                                     | - 「そばから」 is yet another grammar that describes an event that happens right after another. However, unlike the expressions we have covered so far, 「そばから」 implies that the events are a recurring pattern. For example, you would use this grammar to express the fact that you just clean and clean your room only for it to get dirty again soon after.<br>- Besides this difference, the rules for using this expression are exactly the same as 「が早いか」 and 「や否や」. Just attach 「そばから」 to the dictionary form of the first verb that occurred.<br>読む → 読むそばから<br>する → するそばから |
| 思いきや                                                     | - You use this grammar when you think one thing, but much to your astonishment, things actually turn out to be very different.<br>- Attach 「思いきや」 to the thought using the quotation 「と」.<br/>ある → ある*と* → あると*思いきや* |
| ～がてら                                                     | - This rather formal and seldom-used grammar is used to indicate that two actions were done at the same time. The nuance is a bit difference from 「ながら」 in that some or all of the time spent on doing one action was also used to do another action as an aside. Remember, 「ながら」 is used to describe two exactly concurrent actions.<br>- Attach 「がてら」 to the noun or masu verb stem of the main action. In case of a noun, the verb 「する」 is inferred.<br>散歩 → 散歩がてら<br>作る → 作り → 作りがてら |
| ～あげく（挙句）                                             | - 「あげく」 is a grammar used to describe a result, usually negative, that came about after a great deal of effort. Because this grammar is used to describe a result from an action already completed, it is used with the past tense of the verb. 「あげく」 is essentially treated the same as any noun. In other words, you would need the 「の」 particle to modify another noun.<br>- Attach 「あげく」 to the verb or noun that created the end result （「の」 particle is required for nouns）<br>けんか → けんかのあげく<br>考えた → 考えたあげく |
| の Adjectives                                                | - The term no-adjective refers to Japanese adjectives created by adding the no の particle after a noun. Generally speaking, "noun-no-noun" uses the first noun to describe the second noun somehow.<br>Densetsu no Yamada Tae (densetsu = legend)<br>The Legendary Yamada Tae.<br>- The particle の makes a modifier of a noun. The exact relationship between the modifier and the modified noun can be almost anything; Daijisen lists fourteen relationships such as ownership, belonging, location of existence, location of action, time, and so on, and one of them is “attribute and condition.” |
| まだ...ない                                                  | - used to express "not ... yet"                              |
| 得る                                                         | - As auxiliary verb that expresses possibility.<br>- Equivalent: Can; possible; -able<br>- This verb is very curious in that 「得」 can either be read as 「う」 or 「え」 but if conjugated, it must always be read as 「え」. You may wonder how often one talks about the ability to exist. In practice, this word is primarily used to describe whether a situation or event （こと） can occur. |
| こと                                                         | A nominaliser used to indicate the speaker’s relative lack of empathy with the content of the sentence he is nominalising. |
| なんて<br>なんか                                             | - They are basically "weak" form of は in [this](https://japanese.stackexchange.com/questions/421/usage-of-%e3%81%aa%e3%82%93%e3%81%a6-and-%e3%81%aa%e3%82%93%e3%81%8b-as-emphasis) context. E.g. 愛なんか要らない。(I don't need love!)<br>- Comparable to "like" in English.<br>- なんて is actually a contracted form of 等という (etc.)<br>- なんか, on the other hand, is a contracted form of　何か, meaning "something". I see なんか as more of a filler than なんて, but I do agree that they're often used interchangeably, despite being different words. [[src](https://japanese.stackexchange.com/a/450/36809)] |
| 皆さん                                                       | - 同志の皆さん is okay to translate "comrades"<br>- 同志の皆さん may also indicate "like-minded people" |
|                                                              |                                                              |
|                                                              |                                                              |
|                                                              |                                                              |



# Grammar Groups



## Connecting Sentences (and, or, because, etc)

| Japanese | Explanation |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| て・で   | For **comma lists for nouns and adjectives**, like "He is X, Y, and Z".<br>Nouns and na-adjectives: Attach で, e.g. 静かで<br>i-adjectives: Negative stem + て, e.g. 暑くない → 暑くて.<br>Also for conjugated nouns: 彼女じゃない → 彼女じゃなくて.<br>The last item isn't conjugated to the て ending. <br>E.g. 田中さんは、お金持ち*で*、かっこ*よくて*、魅力的ですね。<br>"Tanaka-san is rich, handsome, and charming, isn’t he?"<br>For **verbs** use the regular て form. E.g.<br>食堂に*行って*、昼ご飯を*食べて*、昼寝をする。<br>"I will go to cafeteria, eat lunch, and take a nap." |
| とか・や | **"and", "or" for nouns**, implies more items. E.g. "X and Y and Z etc.". とか is more colloquial than や. Tense is determined by the last verb. Examples:<br>飲み物*や*カップ*や*ナプキンは、いらない？<br>"You don’t need (things like) drink, cup, or napkin, etc.?"<br>飲み物*とか*カップ*とか*ナプキンは、いらない？<br>You don’t need (things like) drink, cup, or napkin, etc.? |
|たり|- **Verb version of the や particle**, implies other items. <br>- Conjugate the verb into past tense and add り (i.e. たり、だり). At the end attach the verb する.<br>- Tense is determined by the last verb.<br>映画を見たり、本を読んだり、昼寝したりする。<br>"I do things like (among other things) watch movies, read books, and take naps."|
|し|- **List for reasons** for multiple states or actions.<br>- Works like や. Also implies that there are other reasons.<br>- For any non-conjugated noun or na-adjective you need to add だ.<br>先生だし、年上だし・・・。<br>"Well, he’s/she’s the teacher, and older…"<br>優しいし、かっこいいし、面白いから。<br>"Because he’s kind, attractive, and interesting (among other things)."|
| から     | - because; since<br>- The two sentences are always ordered [reason] から [result].<br>- When the reason is a non-conjugated noun or na-adjective you must use だから, otherwise it would sound like "from". |
| ので     | - because of ...; the reason is ...;<br>- Pretty much the same as から. [reason] から [result]<br>- When the reason is a non-conjugated noun or na-adjective you must use なので<br>- Like のだ this can occur as ので、んで、なので、なんで |
| のに     | - despite<br>- Used as ので. Also needs a な when used with non-conjugated noun or na-adjective.<br>E.g.  学生なのに、彼女は勉強しない。<br>"Despite being a student, she does not study." |
| けど・が | - but; however; although<br>- Used in the same manner as から and ので, but expresses contradiction.<br>- If there is no contraction, then the meaning is more like "and".<br>- Just like 「から」 the declarative 「だ」 is required for nouns and na-adjectives. E.g.<br>今日は暇だけど、明日は忙しい。<br>"I’m free today but I will be busy tomorrow."<br>デパートに行きましたが、何も欲しくなかったです。<br>"I went to department store but there was nothing I wanted." |



## Te-form Stem Usages

- :exclamation: **NOTE:** The *te* form of a Japanese verb is used when the verb has some kind of connection to the following words.

| て・で +addition&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | Meaning                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 〜て、〜で、...                                              | - Multiple verbs in te-form in a list express a sequence of actions, i.e. it works like "and", "then", etc. Note: This is only for casual speech. The formal version of this is to use the masu form stem.<br>食べなくて寝た。<br>"I didn’t eat, (and) then I went to sleep"<br>- Single verbs in te-form express a request for an action. See ～てください. |
| ～てください                                                 | - Means "Please do X" <br>- It's a conjugation of 下さる, which is a honorific form of くれる. Like being handed down something.<br>- In casual speech, it is often common to simply drop the ください part.<br>- Negative is built via "negative form" + で. E.g. 買わないで. |
| 〜ないで                                                     | - Request to not do something.<br>- Negative is built via "negative form" + で. E.g. 買わないで.<br>- 「くれる」 or 「もらえる」can be added at the end. Can also be omitted.<br>高い物を買わないでくれる？<br/>Can you not buy expensive thing(s)?<br>- Indicate an action that was done *without* doing another action<br>何も食べないで寝ました。<br>Went to sleep without eating anything. |
| ～ている                                                     | - Indicates continuous action, i.e. "currently doING something".<br>- Conjugations work the same as with 居る.<br>E.g. 読んでいます (is reading, polite), 読んでいない (is not reading)<br>- Can also indicate an "enduring state-of-being".<br>E.g. 知っている = "I know", 持っている = "to have / possess"<br>- When used with motion verbs like 行っている or 来ている it means that you "completed the motion, and now you exist in that state."<br>- Short form is てる |
| ～てある                                                     | - By replacing 「いる」 with 「ある」, instead of a continuing action, it becomes a resultant state after the action has already taken place. Usually, this expression is used to explain that something is in a state of completion. |
| ～ておく                                                     | - While 「～てある」 carries a nuance of a completed action in preparation for something else, 「～ておく」 explicitly states that the action is done (or will be done) with the future in mind. E.g.<br>晩ご飯を作っておく。<br>I make dinner (in advance for the future).<br>- Short form is ～とく |
| ～ていく<br>～てくる                                         | - When “to go” 行く or “to come” 来る is used with the te-form, to show that an action is oriented toward or from someplace. While 「持っている」 means you are in a state of holding something (in possession of), when the 「いる」 is replaced with 「いく」 or 「くる」, it means you are taking or bringing something. |
| 〜てはだめ<br>〜てはいけない<br>〜てはならない               | - Expresses things that must NOT be done<br>- いけない and ならない conjugate like i-adjectives but are not actual adjectives.<br>- Base for いけない is いける (行ける)<br>- Base for ならない is なる (成る)<br>ここに入ってはいけません。<br>"You must not enter here." |
| ~ても...                                                     | - Saying something is ok to do or not do<br>- Te-form and the 「も」 particle, you are essentially saying, “even if you do X…” Common words that come after this include いい, 大丈夫, or 構わない. E.g.<br>~てもいい<br>~ても大丈夫<br/>~ても構わない<br/>全部飲んでも構わないよ。<br>I don’t mind if you drink it all. (lit: Even if you drink it all, I don’t mind, you know.) |
| ~てみる                                                      | - To try something out<br>- Mnemonic: Sequence of an action and then seeing the result<br>- Conjugations happen on as always on 見る<br>お酒を飲んでみましたが、すごく眠くなりました。<br>I tried drinking alcohol and I became extremely sleepy. |
| 〜てあげる                                                   | - Express the giving of a favor (verb) you must use the ever useful te-form and then attach 「あげる」. See "Giving and receiving" |
| 〜てもらえる<br>〜てくれる                                   | - Make requests. See "Giving and receiving".                 |
| ~て欲しい                                                    | - When combined with the te-form of a verb, it means “to want something done”<br>部屋をきれいにしてほしいのよ。<br>It is that I want the room cleaned up, you know. |
| 〜てしまった                                                 | - Express an action that is done or happened unintentionally.<br>毎日ケーキを食べて、２キロ太ってしまいました。<br>I ate cake everyday and I (unintentionally) gained two kilograms. |



## Masu Form Stem Usages

| ます-stem + addition&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | Explanation                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 〜たい                                                       | - means "want to", if negated "don't want to"<br>- たい is conjugated like an i-adjective, i.e. negative = たくない<br>温泉に行きたい。<br>I want to go to hot spring. |
| 〜ましょう                                                   | - volitional form (polite)<br>- Same as "Volitional form (casual)" (see Unsorted Grammar Point), but formal |
| 〜なさい                                                     | - Firm but polite requests. See "Making requests".           |
| 〜すぎる                                                     | - When 「すぎる」 is attached to the end of other verbs and adjectives, it means that it is too much or that it has exceeded the normal levels. |
| 〜ながら                                                     | - Used to express that one action is taking place in conjunction with another action. See 〜ながら |
| 〜まくる                                                     | - Verb suffix to indicate reckless abandon to the activity. See 〜まくる |
| 〜方                                                         | - Verb suffix to express a way to do that verb. See Making Comparisons. |
| ～やすい<br>～にくい                                         | - To describe an action as being easy, change the verb to the stem and add 「やすい」. To describe an action as being difficult, attach 「にくい」 to the stem. |
| 〜っぱなし<br/>〜っ放し                                      | - As suffix you can attach it to the masu stem of any verb to describe the act of doing something and leaving it that way without changing it. |
| Sequences in formal speech                                   | - To express sequences of actions in formal speech the te-form is not used. This practice is used only in regular everyday speech. Formal speeches, narration, and written publications employ the masu verb stem instead of the te-form to describe sequential actions. |
| 〜さえ                                                       | - Expresses the minimum requirement of something. Attach to masu stem if the word is not already in te-form. See Expectations. |



## Negative-form Stem Usages

| Neg.&nbsp;stem&nbsp;+&nbsp;addi.&nbsp; | Explanation                                                  |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 〜で                                   | - Negative te-form, used for negative requests. See 〜ないで.<br>- Can also mean without. |
| 〜ず                                   | - Same as 〜ないで meaning "without" but more formal.<br>- Exceptional conjugations: する → せず、くる → こず |
| 〜ん                                   | - Shortened version of "stem + ない"<br>- Exceptional conjugations: する → せん、くる → こん |
| 〜ぬ                                   | - Shortened version of "stem + ない"<br>- Exceptional conjugations: する → せぬ、 くる → こぬ |



## Expressing Volitions

| Vol.&nbsp;stem&nbsp;+&nbsp;addi.&nbsp; | Explanation                                                  |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|Volitional form&nbsp;(casual)|- The term volitional here means a will to do something. E.g. “let’s” or “shall we?”<br>テーマパークに行こう！<br>Let’s go to theme park!|
| 〜とする                               | - To attempt to do something<br>- You need to conjugate the verb into the volitional, enclose it in a quotation (so that we can perform an action on the clause) and finally add the verb する<br>毎日、勉強を避けようとする。<br>Everyday, she attempts to avoid study.<br>- we can use different verbs to do other things with the attempt. For instance, we can use the verb 「決める」 to say, “decide to attempt to do [X]”. Or 思う to say "thought to attempt to do X" |
| Negative volitional | - The negative volitional is used to express negative intention. This means that there is a will for something to not happen or that someone is set out to not do something. As a result, because one is trying not to do something, it’s probably not going to happen. Essentially, it is a very stiff and formal version of 「でしょう」 and 「だろう」. That doesn’t mean you can use the negative volitional to say “let’s not” or “try not to”. The tone of this grammar is one of very strong determination to not do something<br>- Verbs are conjugated to the negative volitional by simply attaching 「まい」 to the verb. Another alternative is to attach 「まい」 to the masu stem.<br>- For ru-verbs: Attach「まい」 to the verb or verb stem.<br/>見る → 見るまい<br/>見る → 見まい<br/>- For u-verbs: Attach 「まい」 to the end of the verb: 行くまい<br/>Exceptions:<br/>する → するまい or しまい<br/>くる → くるまい<br/>- This conjugation must always come last. For masu-form, attach 「まい」 to the masu-form verb. なる → なり → なります → なりますまい |
| やめる | - You cannot use the negative volitional to say “let’s not” or “try not to”. In order to express “let’s not”, you can use the verb, 「やめる」 with the regular volitional. In order to express an effort to not do something, you can use 「ようにする」 with the negative verb. |
| Express a lack of relation | - We can use both volitional and negative volitional forms to say it doesn’t matter whether something is going to happen or not.<br>- Attach 「が」 to the volitional and negative volitional form of the verb.<br>食べる → 食べよう　/　食べまい → 食べようが　/　食べまいが<br>行く → 行こう　/　行くまい → 行こうが　/　行くまいが |
|であろう|- Used to express likelihood<br>- The answer is to conjugate the verb 「ある」 from the formal state-of-being 「である」 to the volitional to produce 「であろう」. Remember 「でしょう」 can already be used as a polite form, so this form is even a step above that in formality.<br>困難 → 困難であろう<br>する → するであろう|
|かろう|- Volitional for い endings<br>- We learned in the lesson about formal grammar that 「ではない」 was the negative of 「である」. So how would we say something like 「であろう」 but for the negative? Remove the last 「い」 and attach 「かろう」. You can use it for negatives and i-adjectives just like the 「かった」 past conjugation form.<br>ではない → ではなかろう<br>早い → 早かろう|

### More intentions

- `～たいと思う` means "I think I'd like to...":

  > 本を読みたいと思う "I think I'd like to read a book"

- `～ましょう` means "let's do..." (polite form):

  > 本を読みましょう "Let's read a book"

- `～しようと思う` means "I think I'll...":

  > 本を読もうと思う "I think I'll read a book"

- `～しようとする` means "I'll try to..." as you said:

  > 本を読もうとする "I'll try to read a book"

- `～するところ` means "I'm about to..."/"I'm at the point of..." or "place for (do)ing...":

  > 本を読むところ "I'm about to read a book" or "place for reading books"

- `～つもり` means "I intend to", slightly less formal than `～予定がある` I think and is less likely to be used in business etc:

  > 本を読むつもりだ "I intend to read a book"

- `～する予定がある` "I have plans to" as stated:

  > 本を読む予定がある "I have plans to read a book"

- `～する気がある` "I am of a mind to":

  > 本を読む気がある "I am of a mind to read a book"

- I think `～ことにする` translates differently depending on the context, but that it generally means "(will) go with (do)ing...":

  > 今週こそは本を読むことにする "I will go with reading a book this week"

  

## Conditionals (if-then)

| Type             | Explanation                                                  |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| と               | - Natural consequence conditional. Simple if-then. E.g.<br>電気を消す*と*暗くなる。<br>"If you turn off the lights, it will get dark." |
| なら             | - Contextual conditional. You can use this particle to express what will happen given a certain context. A context must be present to use it. Hypothetical form of the copula だ, from なり<br>- Attach なら to the context in which the conditional would occur. You must NOT attach the declarative だ.<br>みんなが行く*なら*私も行く。<br>"If given that everybody is going, then I’ll go too." |
| Conditional&nbsp;Form (e + ば) | - Conditional just expresses a regular “if” condition without any assumptions or embedded meanings. Uses conditional form.<br>楽しければ、私も行く。<br>"If it’s fun, I’ll go too."<br>- For verbs: Change the last /u/ vowel sound to the equivalent /e/ vowel sound and attach 「ば」<br>食べる　→　食べれ → 食べれば<br>For i-adjectives or negatives ending in 「ない」: Drop the last 「い」 and attach 「ければ」.<br>ない　→　なければ<br>For nouns and na-adjectives: Attach 「であれば」<br>学生　→　学生であれば |
|ば / たら + どう|- This literally means, “If you do [X], how is it?” In English, this would become, “How about doing [X]?”<br>銀行に行ったらどうですか。<br>How about going to bank?|
| たら / だら      | - Past tense + ら.<br>- Like the ば conditional, it is also a general conditional.<br>お金があったらいいね。<br>"If I had money, it would be good, huh?"<br>- The past conditional is the only type of conditional where the result can be in the past.<br>家に帰ったら、誰もいなかった。<br>When I went home, there was no one there. (unexpected result) |
|もし|- NOT a conditional<br>- もし is a supplement to add a sense of uncertainty on whether the condition is true.<br>もしよかったら、映画を観に行きますか？<br>"If by any chance it’s ok with you, go to watch movie?"|



## Must / Must not

| Japanese                                                     | Explanation                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Must NOT do<br>〜てはだめ<br>〜てはいけない<br>〜てはならない | - Expresses things that must NOT be done<br>- いけない and ならない conjugate like i-adjectives but are not actual adjectives.<br>- Base for いけない is いける (行ける)<br>- Base for ならない is なる (成る)<br>ここに入ってはいけません。<br>"You must not enter here." |
| Must be done                                                 | - Negative te-form + 「は」 (wa) particle + だめ／いけない／ならない<br>宿題をしなくてはいけなかった<br>Had to do homework.<br>- Negative form + 「と」 conditional + だめ／いけない／ならない<br>宿題をしないといけない<br>Have to do homework.<br>- Negative verb stem + 「ければ」 conditional + だめ／いけない／ならない. なければ is the conditional of ない.<br>宿題を*しなければ*だめだった。<br>Had to do homework. |
| Must be done simplified                                      | - Simply replace 「なくて」 with 「なくちゃ」<br>勉強しなくちゃ。<br>Gotta study.<br>- Simply replace 「なければ」 with 「なきゃ」<br>ご飯を食べなきゃ。<br>Gotta eat.<br>- The 「と」 conditional is also used by itself to imply 「だめ／いけない／ならない」.<br>学校に行かないと。<br>Gotta go to school. |



## Relative Clauses

| Japanese | Explanation                                                  |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| // todo  | we learned how to treat a relative clause like an adjective to directly modify a noun. が stuff and shit. https://github.com/jihadichan/jp/blob/master/ubersentences/grammarguide/items/170.md |
|adjective to modify a noun|If there are "qualifiers" before the subject, then it's a relative sentence. e.g. <br>学生だった人は... - Person who was a student...|
| direct&nbsp;quote          |- Directly quoting something that was said<br>- と added to the end of the quote.<br>アリスが、「寒い」と言った。<br>Alice said, “Cold”.|
|interpreted / indirect quote|- Quote along the lines of what someone actually said. It’s not a word-for-word quote. Works the same way as a direct way. <br>- Besides the standard “he said”, “she said”, we can perform the action, “to think” or “to hear” to produce phrases, e.g. “I think [clause]” or “I heard [clause]”<br>今、どこに行こうかと考えている。<br>Now, I’m considering where to set out to go.<br>- If the quoted relative clause is a state-of-being for a noun or na-adjective, you have to explicitly include the declarative 「だ」 to show this.<br>彼は高校生だと聞いたけど、信じられない。<br>I heard that he is a high school student but I can’t believe it.|
|casual quote|- Use って instead of と and drop the rest of the sentence<br>もうお金がないって。<br>I already told you I have no money.<br>-って can also be used to talk about practically anything. Most of the time it is used in place of the は particle to simply bring up a topic.|



## Defining and Describing

- :heavy_exclamation_mark::heavy_exclamation_mark::heavy_exclamation_mark: All those quote sentences are simply "that" sentences. E.g. "he said that", "that's not what I said". Everything where you put a "that" into.

| Japanese____ | Explanation                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Define with<br>と言う                                        | - When you want to say how something is referred to<br>これは、なんという魚ですか。<br>What is this fish referred to as?<br>私はアリスといいます。<br>I am called Alice. (lit: As for me, you say Alice.) |
| Describe&nbsp;with<br>と言う                                 | - When a relative clause is encapsulated with 「と」, you must have a verb to go along with it and 「いう」 is simply being used as a generic verb to enable us to talk about any relative clause. This allows us to describe and explain just about anything.<br>リブートというのは、パソコンを再起動するということです。<br>Reboot means to restart your computer. |
| こう言う<br>そう言う<br>ああ言う<br>どう言う                 | - こういう - this way<br>- そういう - that way<br>- ああいう - that way (far away in an abstract sense)<br>- どういう - what way<br>あんたは、いつもこういう時に来るんだから、困るんだよ。<br>It’s because you always come at times like these that I’m troubled. |
| というか                                                     | - This construction is used when you want to rephrase or redefine something such as the following dialogue.<br>う～ん、彼女というか、友達というか、なんというか・・・<br>Um, you might say girlfriend, or friend, or something…<br>- というか can also be written as ということ, and probably というの |
| ということ                                                   | - Rather than using 「か」 to rephrase a conclusion, we can also simply use 「こと」 to sum up something without rephrasing anything.<br>ということは、みきちゃんは、今彼氏がいないということ？<br>Does that mean Miki-chan doesn’t have a boyfriend now? |
|だって|「だって」is also another phrase that leaves out just about everything. By convention, it is used to express disagreement or dissatisfaction usually to whine, complain, or to make an excuse but you can’t tell what it means just from looking at it. It is an abbreviation of something along the lines of 「とはいっても」 meaning, “even if that was the case”.|
|Shortened forms|- って is very often used in causal slang in place of と, because it allows us to leave out the rest of the sentence and assume context.<br>来年留学するというのは、智子のこと？<br>The studying abroad next year thing, is that Tomoko?<br>来年留学するって智子のこと？<br>The studying abroad next year thing, is that Tomoko?<br>- In some cases, the small つ is left out and just て is used instead of って.<br>ていうか、もう帰らないとだめですけど。<br>Rather than that, I have to go home already.<br>- と言うのは, と言うことは can be shortened to てことは|
|ゆう (also 言う)|- In conversations, it is quite normal to say 「ゆう」 instead of 「いう」.<br>そうゆうことじゃないって！<br>I said it’s not like that (lit: it’s not that type of thing)!|
|てな|comes from 「というような」, GT: "Like"|
|てなわけで|「てなわけで」＝「というようなわけで」（≒「というわけで」）<br>"with that being said" or "for that reason"|

## Giving and receiving

| Japanese | Explanation                                                  |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 上げる   | -「あげる」 is the Japanese word for “to give” seen from the speaker’s point of view.<br>これは先生にあげる。<br>I’ll give this to teacher.<br>- In order to express the giving of a favor (verb) you must use the ever useful te-form<br>代わりに行ってあげる。<br/>I’ll give you the favor of going in your place.<br>- For third-person, this verb is used when the speaker is looking at it from the giver’s point of view.<br>学生がこれを先生にあげる。<br>The student give this to teacher. (looking at it from the student’s point of view) |
| 遣る     | - Usually used for pets, animals, and such, you can substitute 「やる」, which normally means “to do”, for 「あげる」.<br>犬に餌をやった？<br/>Did you give the dog food?<br>- In order to ask for a favor you must use the ever useful te-form<br>車を買ってくれるの？<br>You’ll give me the favor of buying a car for me? |
| 暮れる   | - 「くれる」 is also a verb meaning “to give” but unlike 「あげる」, it is from the receiver’s point of view. You must use this verb when someone *else* is giving something or doing something for you<br>友達が私にプレゼントをくれた。<br>Friend gave present to me.<br>- Similarly, when used in the third-person, the speaker is speaking from the receiver’s point of view and not the giver.<br>先生がこれを学生にくれる。<br>The teacher give this to student. (looking at it from the student’s point of view) |
| 貰う<br>もらう | - “to receive” ([src](http://www.guidetojapanese.org/learn/grammar/favors))<br>私が友達*に*プレゼントをもらった。<br>I received present from friend. |
|Asking&nbsp;favors|See "Making requests"|
|Asking not to do&nbsp;something|See "Making requests"|



## Making Requests

- :heavy_exclamation_mark: NOTE: 「ください」 is a special conjugation of 「くださる」, which is the honorific form of 「くれる」. Because 「ください」 like the masu-form must always come at the end sentence or a relative clause, you cannot use it to directly modify a noun. But you can still use it inside a sentence if it's in a direct quote (see と)

| Japanese                                            | Explanation                                                  |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Asking&nbsp;favors<br>くれる<br>もらえる (pot. frm) | - You can make requests by using 「くれる」 and the potential form of 「もらう」 (can I receive the favor of…). by attaching it to the te-form of a verb<br>- It is not normal to explicitly include the subject and target like this:<br>あなたが、私に千円を貸してくれる？<br>Will you give me the favor of lending 1000 yen?<br>私が、あなたに千円を貸してもらえる？<br>Can I receive the favor of you lending 1000 yen?<br>- You can use the negative to make the request a little softer.<br>ちょっと静かにしてくれない？<br>Won’t you be a little quieter?<br>漢字で書いてもらえませんか。<br/>Can you write this in kanji for me? |
| Asking not&nbsp;to&nbsp;do&nbsp;something           | - In order to request that someone *not* do something, you simply attach 「で」 to the negative form of the verb and proceed as before.<br>高い物を買わないでくれる？<br>Can you not buy expensive thing(s)? |
| 〜をください<br>〜をくれる？<br>〜てくれ            | -「ください」here is a direct request for something while 「くれる」 is used as a question asking for someone to give something.<br>それをください。<br>Please give me that.<br>それをくれる？<br>Can you give me that?<br>- To sound particularly commanding and manly, remove the る.<br>日本語で話してくれ。<br/>Speak in Japanese. |
| 〜てください<br>〜ないでください                    | - Direct polite request. Te-form + ください<br>漢字で書いてください。<br>Please write it in kanji.<br>- Negative request: Negative te-form + ください<br>ここにこないでください。<br>Please don’t come here. |
| ～ちょうだい<br>〜頂戴                              | - Casual request. A casual alternative of 「ください」. Has a slightly feminine and childish nuance and is always written in Hiragana. Grammatically, it’s used exactly the same way as 「ください」. |
| ～なさい                                            | - Firm but polite request. Used when a mother is scolding her child or when a teacher wants a delinquent student to pay attention.<br>- masu-stem + なさい<br>- You can also drop 「さい」 portion of the 「なさい」 to make a casual version of this grammar.よく聞きなさい！<br>Listen well!<br>まだいっぱいあるから、たくさん食べな。<br>There’s still a lot, so eat a lot. |
| Imperative Form                                     | - In reality, the command form is rarely used as Japanese people tend to be too polite to use imperatives.<br>- See imperative form conjugations<br>あっち行け！<br>Go away!<br>- Negative command form. Simply attach simply attach な to the base verb.<br>それを食べるな！<br>Don’t eat that! |



## Numbers and Counting

- The Japanese number system is spread into units of four. So a number such as 10,000,000 is actually split up as 1000,0000.
  - That's why they go from 10k to 100m to 1 trillion ...
  - Once you get past 1万 (10,000), you start all over until you reach 9,999万, then it rotates to 1億 (100,000,000).
- You can simply count from 1 to 99 with just these ten numbers. Japanese is easier than English in this respect because you do not have to memorize separate words such as “twenty” or “fifty”. In Japanese, it’s simply just “two ten” and “five ten”.

## Casual Patterns and Slang

- The fundamental goal of slang is to reduce mouth movement, example 1:<br>ここ**はつまら**ないから私**の家に**行こう。<br>ここ**つまん**ないから、私**んち**行こう。<br>Example 2:<br>**まった**く、いつまでこんな**ところ**で、ぐずぐず**するん**だよ。<br>**った**く、　いつまでこんな**とこ**で、　ぐずぐず**すん**だよ。<br>
- While written Japanese already has fairly loose rules regarding sentence order, casual spoken Japanese takes it one step further.<br>Correct: それは何？<br>Slang: 何それ？
- 「じゃん」 is an abbreviation of 「じゃない」, the negative conjugation for nouns and na-adjectives. 
  - Though derived from 「じゃない」, 「じゃん」 is always used to confirm the positive.
  - It can be attached to the end of any sentence regardless of whether it ends in a noun, adjective, verb, or adverb.
  - 「じゃん」 is basically saying something along the lines of, “See, I’m right, aren’t I?”
- Using 「つ」 for 「という」. This may sound hard to believe but if you really slur 「という」 together, it becomes something resembling 「つ」. E.g.<br>だから、違うんだつうの！<br>"Like I said, you’re wrong!"
  - If you want even more emphasis, you can even add a small 「つ」. This usually means you are really at the brink of your patience. E.g.<br>だから、違うんだっつうの！<br>"Like I said, you’re wrong!"
- 「ってば」 and 「ったら」 is yet another type of abbreviation for 「という」 similar to 「って」 as discussed in the defining and describing section.  In this case, it’s an abbreviation of the conditional form of 「という」, which is 「といえば」 and 「といったら」. By using this abbreviation, you are essentially saying something along the lines of, “If I told you once, I told you a million times!”<br>もう行くってば！<br>"I told you I’m going already!"
- In the case of 「何か」, while 「なにか」 is the correct reading, it is often contracted to just 「なんか」 in casual speech.
  - 「なんか」 also has a function similar to the word “like” in English. By “like”, I’m not talking about the actual word but the kind that has no meaning and some people use just about anywhere in the sentence. Similarly, 「なんか」 can also be used as a filler without any actual meaning. <br>今日は、なんか忙しいみたいよ。(なんか is just a filler word and can be left out)<br>"I guess he’s like busy today."
- 「やがる」 is a verb suffix used to indicate hatred or contempt for the person doing the action. Strong language is not used in normal, everyday conversations. You simply attach it to the masu-stem of the verb. After that, 「やがる」 is conjugated just like a regular る-verb. <br>あんなやつに負けやがって。じゃ、どうすんだよ？<br>"Losing to a guy like that. Well, what are you going to do?"
  - Stems maybe from 嫌がる (iyagaru, to dislike) ?



## Causative and Passive Verbs

- English passive: 
  - Active: I have made a cake. - Passive: A cake has been made.
  - The noun or noun phrase that would be the object of a corresponding active sentence appears as the subject of a sentence or clause in the passive voice.
  - We only use the passive when we are interested in the object or when we do not know who caused the action.
- English causative:
  - A Causative Form is used to show that someone assigns something to someone else.
  - The causative form (see verbs conjugation) can mean either making or letting  someone do something, i.e. “make someone do” and “let someone do”.

| Japanese                        | Explanation                                                  |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Causative&nbsp;Verbs            | - The causative form (see verbs conjugation) can mean either making or letting  someone do something, i.e. “make someone do” and “let someone do”. The result is then conjugated like an -eる verb.<br>- When the causative form is used with 「あげる」 and 「くれる」, it almost always means to “let someone do”.<br>先生が質問をたくさん聞かせてくれた。<br>Teacher let (someone) ask lots of questions.<br>その部長は、よく長時間働かせる。<br/>That manager often makes (people) work long hours. |
| Shortened Causative Form        | - Instead of せる the ending becomes す, e.g. 行かせる -> 行かす<br>- If the causative form has a さ stem (e.g. iる & eる verbs), then it becomes さす, e.g. 食べさせる -> 食べさす<br>- 「する」 becomes 「さす」<br>- 「くる」 becomes 「こさす」<br>- The further conjugation is then that of す verbs |
| Passive Form                    | - The passive form 〜られる is used to express that something is done to somebody (or something?). Conjugation in that is that of -eる verbs<br>- Passive verbs are verbs that are done to the (passive) subject. Unlike English style of writing which discourages the use of the passive form, passive verbs in Japanese are often used in essays and articles. So it's like konjunktiv in German.<br>外国人に質問を聞かれたが、答えられなかった。<br>I was asked a question by a foreigner but I couldn’t answer.<br>- Using passive form is another more polite way to express an action. In Japanese, a sentence is usually more polite when it is less direct.<br>どうする？ – What will you do? (lit: How do?)<br/>どうしますか？ – Regular polite.<br/>どうされますか？- Passive polite. |
| Causative-Passive Forms         | - The causative-passive form is simply the combination of causative and passive conjugations to mean that the action of making someone do something was done to that person. This would effectively translate into, “[someone] is made to do [something]”. The important thing to remember is the order of conjugation. The verb is first conjugated to the causative and then passive, never the other way around. E.g. 食べる → 食べさせる → 食べさせられる<br>朝ご飯は食べたくなかったのに、食べさせられた。<br/>Despite not wanting to eat breakfast, I *was made to eat* it. |
| Shorter Causative-Passive Forms | - Going along with the shorter causative alternative, you can also use the same conjugation for the causative-passive form. The idea is to simply used the shortened causative form instead of using the regular causative conjugation.<br>行く → 行か → 行かす → 行かされる<br>- This form cannot be used in cases where the shorter causative form ends in 「さす」, in other words, you can’t have a 「さされる」 ending. I.e. this is WRONG:<br>食べ*る* → 食べ*さす* → 食べ~~さされる~~ |



## Honorific and Humble Forms

- The first thing to remember is that the speaker always considers himself/herself to be at the lowest level. So any actions performed by oneself are in humble form while actions performed by anyone else seen from the view of the speaker uses the honorific form.
- Mostly you just replace words.

| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| お + stem + になる<br>Can be other conjugation stem?         | This kind of makes sense if you think of it as a person becoming the honorific state of a verb. All subsequent conjugations follow the normal rules of conjugating the u-verb 「なる」.<br>先生はお見えになりますか。<br>Have you seen the teacher? |
| お + stem + です<br/>Can be other conjugation stem?          | - Makes the polite です honorific<br>店内でお召し上がりですか。<br>Will you be dining in? |
| ください                                                     | - You can also use 「下さい」 with a honorific verb by replacing 「になる」 with 「ください」. This is useful for when you want to ask somebody to do something but still use a honorific verb.<br>少々お待ちください。<br>Please wait a moment. |
| お + stem + する                                             | - Makes する honorific.<br>先生、お聞きしたいことがありますが。<br>Teacher, there’s something I want to ask you. |
| 〜ませ<br>Making honorific requests                          | - Makes polite requests honorific<br>- 下さる → 下さいます → 下さいませ<br>- An abbreviated and less formal version of this is to simply remove the 「ます」 after conjugating to the special masu-form<br>下さる → 下さいます → 下さい<br>いらっしゃる → いらっしゃいます → いらっしゃい |
|                                                              |                                                              |
|                                                              |                                                              |
|                                                              |                                                              |
|                                                              |                                                              |



## Expressing Amounts

| Japanese | Explanation                                                  |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| だけ     | - The particle 「だけ」 is used to express that that’s all there is. Just like the other particles we have already learned, it is directly attached to the end of whichever word that it applies to.<br>- Unlike some particles, you can directly attach 「だけ」 to verbs as well. |
| のみ     | - A particle that is essentially identical both grammatically and in meaning to 「だけ」 is 「のみ」. However, unlike 「だけ」, which is used in regular conversations, 「のみ」 is usually only used in a written context. |
| しか     | - 「しか」 must be used to indicate the lack of everything else. In other words, the rest of the sentence must always be negative.<br>- しか」 has an embedded negative meaning while 「だけ」 doesn’t have any particular nuance.<br>これだけ見る。<br>See just this.<br>これだけ見ない。<br>Don’t see just this.<br>これしか見ない。<br>Don’t see anything else but this. |
| っきゃ   | - 「っきゃ」 is another version of 「しか」 that means essentially the same thing and works exactly the same way. |
| ばかり   | - 「ばかり」 is used to express the condition where there’s so much of something to the point where there’s nothing else.<br>- In more casual situations, 「ばかり」 is usually pronounced 「ばっかり」 or just 「ばっか」. |
| すぎる   | - 「すぎる」 is a regular ru-verb written 「過ぎる」 meaning, “to exceed”.<br>- Verbs: masu-stem + すぎる<br>- na-adjectives: Just attach すぎる<br>- For negative verbs and adjectives: REPLACE last い with さ and attach すぎる.<br>- Most regular i-adjectives such as 「危ない」 or 「少ない」just REMOVE the い  and attach すぎる. |
| も       | - When the 「も」 particle comes after some type of amount, it means that the amount indicated is way too much.<br>昨日、電話三回もしたよ！<br>I called you like three times yesterday! |
| ほど     | The noun 「ほど」（程） is attached to a word in a sentence to express the extent of something. It can modify nouns as well as verbs.<br>今日の天気はそれほど暑くない。<br>Today’s weather is not hot to that extent. |
| ～さ     | - Add 「さ」 to adjectives to indicate an amount of that adjective. For example, we can attach 「さ」 to the adjective for “high” in order to get “height”.<br>- For i-adjectives, replace the い with さ.<br>- For na-adjectives just attach it. |



## Similarity or Hearsay

| Japanese&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | Explanation                                                  |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| よう（様）                                               | - 「よう」 means an appearance or manner. Used to say that something has an appearance or manner of a certain state. This word can be used in many ways to express similarity, i.e. "looks like".<br>ここには、誰もいないようだ。<br>Looks like no one is here.<br>- When directly modifying nouns or na-adjectives, you must use the 「の」 particle for nouns or attach 「な」 to na-adjectives.<br>学生のようだ。<br>Looks like it’s a student.<br>- We can attach the target particle to say things like, “I heard it like that” or “I said it like…”.<br>何も起こらなかったように言った。<br>Said (it) like nothing happened. |
| みたい                                                   | - To say something looks like something else<br>- The main difference is that this 「みたい」 can be attached directly to nouns, adjectives, and verbs just like particles. And it's only used in casual situation.<br>- Do not confuse this with the 「たい」 conjugation of 「見る」.<br>犬みたい - looks like a dog<br>犬じゃないみたい - doesn’t look like a dog<br>犬だったみたい - looked like a dog<br>犬じゃなかったみたい - didn’t look like a dog |
| ～そう                                                   | - Used to indicate a likely outcome given the situation.<br>- Verbs must be changed to the masu stem.<br>- The 「い」 in i-adjectives must be dropped except for 「いい」.<br>-「いい」 must first be conjugated to 「よさ」.<br>- For all negatives, the 「い」 must be replaced with 「さ」.<br>- This grammar does not work with plain nouns.<br>バランスが崩れて、一瞬倒れそうだった。<br>Losing my balance, I seemed likely to fall for a moment.<br>この漬物はおいしそう！<br>I bet this pickled vegetable is tasty! (This pickled vegetable looks good!)<br>- ～そう can't be used with nouns. Use だろう or でしょう (volitional form of だ), e.g. 学生でしょう、学生だろう |
| ～そうだ                                                 | - Used for talking about things you heard that doesn’t necessary have anything to do with how you yourself, think or feel.<br>- Note that this is different from ～そう. Unlike ～そう, you can simply attach 「そうだ」 to verbs and i-adjectives. For na-adjectives and nouns, you must indicate the state-of-being by adding 「だ」 to the noun/na-adjective. Also, notice that 「そう」 itself must always end in 「だ」、「です」、or 「でございます」. These differences are what distinguishes this grammar from the one we learned in the last section. There are no tenses for this grammar.<br>明日、雨が降るそうだ。<br/>I hear that it’s going to rain tomorrow.<br>だそうです。<br>So I hear. |
| ～らしい                                                 | - Used to show that things appear to be a certain way due to what you’ve heard. This is different from 「～そうだ」because 「～そうだ」 indicates something you heard about specifically while 「らしい」 means things seem to be a certain way based on some things you heard about the subject.<br>- 「らしい」 can be directly attached to nouns, adjectives, or verbs. It conjugates like a normal i-adjective.<br>こない*らしい*。<br>Seems like it (based on what I heard). |
| っぽい                                                   | - A really casual way to express similarity is to attach 「っぽい」 to the word that reflects the resemblance. You can use it as a casual version for all the different types of expression for similarity covered above.<br>- 「 っぽい」 conjugates just like an i-adjective<br>あの人はちょっと韓国人っぽいよね。<br>That person looks a little like Korean person, huh? |



## Making Comparisons

| Japanese&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | Explanation                                                  |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 方（ほう）                                               | - Used for comparison by saying one way of things is better, worse, etc., than the other way. Grammatically, it works just like any other regular nouns.<br>- Use it with nouns by utilizing the 「の」 particle.<br>ご飯の方がおいしい<br>- Grammatically, it’s no different from a regular noun.<br>Rice is tastier. (lit: The way of rice is tasty.)<br>学生じゃない方がいいよ。<br/>It’s better to not be a student. (lit: The way of not being student is good.)<br>- For non-negative verbs, you can also use the past tense to add more certainty and confidence, particularly when making suggestions.<br>ゆっくり食べた方が健康にいいよ。<br>It’s better for your health to eat slowly.<br>- You can also attach 「方」 to the masu stem of verbs to express a way to do that verb. In this usage, 「方」 is read as 「かた」 and the result becomes a noun. For example, 「行き方」（いきかた） means, “the way to go” or 「食べ方」（たべかた）means, “the way to eat”.<br>新宿の行き方は分かりますか。<br>Do you know the way to go to Shinjuku?<br>そういう食べ方は体によくないよ。<br>Eating in that way is not good for your body. |
| より                                                     | - You can think of 「より」 as being the opposite of 「方」.<br>- It attaches directly to the back of any word. It is usually used in conjunction with 「方」 to say something like, “This way is better as opposed to that way.”, but it is no requirement to do so.<br>花より団子。<br>Dango rather than flowers. (This is a very famous saying.)<br>ご飯の方が、パンよりおいしい。<br>Rice tastes better than bread. (lit: The rice way is tasty as opposed to bread.)<br>- You can also use 「より」 with question words such as 「誰」、「何」、or 「どこ」 to make a superlative by comparing with everything or everybody else. In this case, though not required, it is common to include the 「も」 particle.<br>商品の品質を何より大切にしています。<br>We place value in product’s quality over anything else. |
| によって                                                 | - When you want to say, “depending on [X]”, you can do this in Japanese by simply attaching 「によって」 to [X]. This is simply the te-form of 「よる」.<br>人によって話が違う。<br>The story is different depending on the person. |
| によると                                                 | - Another expression using 「よる」 is by using it with the target and the decided conditional 「と」 to indicate a source of information. In English, this would translate to “according to [X]” where 「によると」 is attached to [X].<br>天気予報によると、今日は雨だそうだ。<br>According to the weather forecast, I hear today is rain. |



## Expectations

| Japanese       | Explanation                                                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| はず           | - Used to express something that was or is supposed to be. You can treat 「はず」 just like a regular noun as it is usually attached to the adjective or verb that is supposed to be or supposed to happen.<br>日曜日のはず (noun)<br>可能なはず (na-adjective)<br>おいしいはず (i-adjective)<br>帰るはず (verb)<br>Negative: 帰るはず → 帰るはずがない<br>そう簡単に直せるはずがないよ。<br>It’s not supposed to be that easy to fix. |
| べき           | - 「べき」 is a verb suffix used to describe something that is supposed to be done. This suffix is commonly defined as “should”, but cannot be used as a word.<br>- Unlike the 「はず」 grammar, there is no expectation that something is going to happen. Rather, this grammar describes what one should do in a given circumstance.<br>-「べき」 works just like a regular noun and so you can conjugate it as 「べきじゃない」、「べきだった」, and so on.<br>行う → 行うべき<br>する → するべき<br>For the generic “to do ” verb 「する」 only, you can remove the 「る」<br>Example: する＋べき → すべき |
| べく           | - Used to describe what one tries to do<br>- While 「べき」 describes a strong suggestion, changing it to 「べく」 allows you to describe what one did in order to carry out that suggestion<br>- Grammatically, 「べく」 is really a conjunctive form of 「べき」, similar to what the te-form does to connect another phrase.<br>早く帰るべき。<br>Should go home early.<br>早く帰るべく、準備をし始めた。<br>In trying to go home early, started the preparations.<br>Same as 「べき」, you can remove the 「る」 for the generic “to do ” verb 「する」 only<br>Example: する＋べく → すべく |
| べからず       | - Used to describe things one must not do. It's another form of another from of 「べき」, but expresses the opposite meaning.<br>- Conjugations work the same way as above.<br>ゴミ捨てるべからず。<br>You must not throw away trash. |
| さえ<br>でさえ | - In English, we might say, “not even close” to show that not even the minimum expectation has been met. In Japanese, we can express this by attaching 「さえ」 to the object or verb that miserably failed to reach what one would consider to be a bare minimum requirement. Conversely, you can also use the same grammar in a positive sense to express something is all you need.<br>- Nouns: Attach 「さえ」 or 「でさえ」 to the minimum requirement. There are no grammatical differences but it does sound a bit more emphatic.<br>- For verbs: Change the verb to the masu stem and attach 「さえ」. For verbs in te-form, attach 「さえ」 to 「て／で」. You can also attach 「さえ」 to the stem of verbs to express a minimum action for a result.<br>お金さえあれば、何でも出来るよ。<br>The least you need is money and you can do anything.<br>お弁当を買うお金さえなかった。<br>I didn’t even have money to buy lunch.<br>- 「（で）すら」 is a older variation of 「（で）さえ」 that is not as commonly used. It is essentially interchangeable with 「（で）さえ」 except that it is generally used only with nouns. |
| おろか         | - This grammar comes from the adjective 「愚か」 which means to be foolish or stupid. However, in this case, you’re not making fun of something, rather by using 「おろか」, you can indicate that something is so ridiculous that it’s not even worth considering.<br>漢字はおろか、ひらがなさえ読めないよ！<br>Forget about Kanji, I can’t even read Hiragana! |
