# Conjugations

## Conjugation building blocks

- Noun & na-adjectives conjugations are simply conjugations of だ

- i-adjective conjugations are a mix of conjugations from だ　＆　ある

- Verb stems are based on their dictionary form ending, where the vowel is changed in some way.

**だ** - to be, is - verb, copula

A copula is a word meaning “to be”, and is used to predicate a sentence, giving the subject identity, properties, state, or membership in a group. Unlike in English, however, the Japanese copula can’t be used to show existence – instead you must use the verbs いる (iru) for animate beings and ある (aru) for inanimate objects. 

- The verb だ is a contraction of the である
- In the negative forms, じゃ is a colloquial contraction of では. Used in formal documents.
- Replacing じゃありません with じゃないです expresses a stronger negation. Also more colloquial.
- The attributive form of the copula is である, but the particles の and な are generally used instead. This の is the familiar [modifying particle](http://www.japaneseprofessor.com/lessons/beginning/modifying-particle-no/), but in some cases な is used instead (such as the “explaining” construction *na no da/desu*).
- た (not だ) indicates past, i.e. "did", "have done"

| Type                | Plain         | Polite                         | Honorific              |
| ------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Present Affirmative | だ            | です                           | でございます           |
| Past Affirmative    | だった        | でした                         | でございました         |
| Present Negative    | じゃない      | じゃありません<br>じゃないです | ではございません       |
| Past Negative       | じゃなかった  | じゃありませんでした           | ではございませんでした |
| Volitional          | だろう        | でしょう                       | でございましょう       |
| Te-Form             | で            | でありまして                   | でございまして         |
| Conditional         | なら / ならば | であれば                       | であれば               |
| Attributive         | の/な         |                                |                        |

| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|                                                              |                                                              |
| Sentence order                                               | Only rule is that the verb comes at the end. The subject and object can be shifted however you want. |
| Adjectives to adverbs                                        | i-adjectives: 早い → 早く、na-adjectives: きれい → きれいに<br>E.g. 早く食べた - quickly ate |
| Verb + motion verb                                           | Frm: [verb with masu-stem] + [maybe a particle] + 行く OR 来る.<br>E.g. 見に行く - "go to see"<br>Can also be conjugated: 遊びにきた - "came to play"、持っていって - "go and bring" |
| どうか                                                       | どう + か - when used in an "implicit question" (see か particle) it's roughly equivalent to saying “whether or not” |
| Potential form exceptions                                    | Use 見える and 聞こえる when you want to say that you can see or hear something. If however, you wanted to say that you were given the opportunity to see or hear something, you would use the regular potential form. |
| 〜にする                                                     | に + する means “to decide on [X]”.                          |
| 〜なる                                                       | - When using with nouns and na-adjectives use with に, i.e. 〜になる<br>- When using 〜なる with i-adjectives, instead of using ~になる, you need to conjugate the adjective to its negative stem and then attach なる. E.g. 強くなる (become strong), 強くなかった (was not strong), 強くなった (became strong(er))<br>- When using with verbs add a generic noun such as a generic event: こと (事) or an appearance/manner: よう (様） |
| Transitive / Intransitive&nbsp;Verbs                         | The difference between the two is that transitive verbs is an action done by an active agent while intransitive verbs are used when something occurs without a direct agent. |
| 欲しい<br>ほしい                                             | - Want to.<br>- Works like 好き.<br>- When combined with the te-form of a verb, it means “to want something done” |
| Volitional form&nbsp;(casual)                                | - The term volitional here means a will to do something. E.g. “let’s” or “shall we?”<br>テーマパークに行こう！<br>Let’s go to theme park! |
| だい？<br>かい？                                             | - 「かい」 and 「だい」 are strongly masculine sentence endings for asking questions. 「かい」 is used for yes/no questions while 「だい」 is used for open-ended questions. |
| Gender-specific particles                                    | - Using 「わ」 is just like 「よ」 except it will make you sound very feminine<br>-「かしら」 is also a very feminine version of 「かな」(see な particle)<br>-「ぞ」 and 「ぜ」 are identical to 「よ」 except that it makes you sound “cool” and manly |
| Humble Form                                                  | Humble Conjugation: お + stem + する<br>先生、お聞きしたいことがありますが。<br/>Teacher, there’s something I want to ask you. |
| しまう                                                       | - Express an action that has taken place unintentionally often with unsatisfactory results, i.e. "dang it..."<br>しまった！<br>Oh no! (I screwed up!)<br>- Express an action that is done or happened unintentionally.<br>Te-form of verb + しまう<br>毎日ケーキを食べて、２キロ太ってしまいました。<br>I ate cake everyday and I (unintentionally) gained two kilograms.<br>- In casual speech, the 「～てしまう」 is often substituted by 「～ちゃう」 while 「～でしまう」 is substituted by 「じゃう」. Both 「～ちゃう」 and 「～じゃう」 conjugate just like regular u-verbs.<br>- Occasionally but not usually, 「しまう」 will have the meaning “to finish something completely” rather than the unintended action. |
| こと...ある                                                  | - When you combine 「こと」, the generic word for an event with 「ある」, you can talk about whether an event exists or not.<br>- E.g. ことはある、ことはありません、ことがある、ことない、こともない |
| ところ                                                       | - 「ところ」（所） is usually used to indicate a generic physical location. However, it can also hold a much broader meaning ranging from a characteristic to a place in time. |
| もの                                                         | - The generic object noun 「もの」 can be used as a casual and feminine way of emphasizing something. This is identical to the explanatory feminine emphasis expressed by the 「の」 particle. Just like the explanatory 「の」 particle, the 「の」 is often changed into 「ん」 resulting in 「もん」. |
| かもしれない<br>かも知れない                                 | - 「かもしれない」 is used to mean “maybe” or “possibly” and is less certain than the word 「多分」. It attaches to the end of a complete clause.<br>- For noun and na-adjective clauses, the declarative 「だ」 must be removed.<br>- The conjugation base is 知れる<br>- It can be abbreviated to just 「かも」 in casual speech. |
| でしょう                                                     | - 「でしょう」 is used to express a level of some certainty and is close in meaning to 「多分」. Just like 「～です／～ます」, it must come at the end of a complete sentence. It does not have any other conjugations.<br>- You can also replace 「～ですか」 with 「～でしょうか」<br>- In casual speech it can be shortened to 「でしょ」. The casual version has a much stronger flavor often sounding more like, “See, I told you so!”<br>だから、時間がないって言ったでしょう！<br>That’s why I told you there was no time! |
|                                                              |                                                              |



# Grammar Groups



## Connecting sentences (and, or, because, etc)

| Japanese | Explanation |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| て・で   | For **comma lists for nouns and adjectives**, like "He is X, Y, and Z".<br>Nouns and na-adjectives: Attach で, e.g. 静かで<br>i-adjectives: Negative stem + て, e.g. 暑くない → 暑くて.<br>Also for conjugated nouns: 彼女じゃない → 彼女じゃなくて.<br>The last item isn't conjugated to the て ending. <br>E.g. 田中さんは、お金持ち*で*、かっこ*よくて*、魅力的ですね。<br>"Tanaka-san is rich, handsome, and charming, isn’t he?"<br>For **verbs** use the regular て form. E.g.<br>食堂に*行って*、昼ご飯を*食べて*、昼寝をする。<br>"I will go to cafeteria, eat lunch, and take a nap." |
| とか・や | **"and", "or" for nouns**, implies more items. E.g. "X and Y and Z etc.". とか is more colloquial than や. Tense is determined by the last verb. Examples:<br>飲み物*や*カップ*や*ナプキンは、いらない？<br>"You don’t need (things like) drink, cup, or napkin, etc.?"<br>飲み物*とか*カップ*とか*ナプキンは、いらない？<br>You don’t need (things like) drink, cup, or napkin, etc.? |
|たり|- **Verb version of the や particle**, implies other items. <br>- Conjugate the verb into past tense and add り (i.e. たり、だり). At the end attach the verb する.<br>- Tense is determined by the last verb.<br>映画を見たり、本を読んだり、昼寝したりする。<br>"I do things like (among other things) watch movies, read books, and take naps."|
|し|- **List for reasons** for multiple states or actions.<br>- Works like や. Also implies that there are other reasons.<br>- For any non-conjugated noun or na-adjective you need to add だ.<br>先生だし、年上だし・・・。<br>"Well, he’s/she’s the teacher, and older…"<br>優しいし、かっこいいし、面白いから。<br>"Because he’s kind, attractive, and interesting (among other things)."|
| から     | - because; since<br>- The two sentences are always ordered [reason] から [result].<br>- When the reason is a non-conjugated noun or na-adjective you must use だから, otherwise it would sound like "from". |
| ので     | - because of ...; the reason is ...;<br>- Pretty much the same as から. [reason] から [result]<br>- When the reason is a non-conjugated noun or na-adjective you must use なので<br>- Like のだ this can occur as ので、んで、なので、なんで |
| のに     | - despite<br>- Used as ので. Also needs a な when used with non-conjugated noun or na-adjective.<br>E.g.  学生なのに、彼女は勉強しない。<br>"Despite being a student, she does not study." |
| けど・が | - but; however; although<br>- Used in the same manner as から and ので, but expresses contradiction.<br>- If there is no contraction, then the meaning is more like "and".<br>- Just like 「から」 the declarative 「だ」 is required for nouns and na-adjectives. E.g.<br>今日は暇だけど、明日は忙しい。<br>"I’m free today but I will be busy tomorrow."<br>デパートに行きましたが、何も欲しくなかったです。<br>"I went to department store but there was nothing I wanted." |



## Te-form stem usages

- :exclamation: **NOTE:** The *te* form of a Japanese verb is used when the verb has some kind of connection to the following words.

| て・で +addition&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | Meaning                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ～てください                                                 | - Means "Please do X" <br>- It's a conjugation of 下さる, which is a honorific form of くれる. Like being handed down something.<br>- In casual speech, it is often common to simply drop the ください part.<br>- Negative is built via "negative form" + で. E.g. 買わないで. |
| ~ないで                                                      | - Request to not do something.<br>- Negative is built via "negative form" + で. E.g. 買わないで.<br>- 「くれる」 or 「もらえる」can be added at the end. Can also be omitted.<br>高い物を買わないでくれる？<br/>Can you not buy expensive thing(s)? |
| ～ている                                                     | - Indicates continuous action, i.e. "currently doING something".<br>- Conjugations work the same as with 居る.<br>E.g. 読んでいます (is reading, polite), 読んでいない (is not reading)<br>- Can also indicate an "enduring state-of-being".<br>E.g. 知っている = "I know", 持っている = "to have / possess"<br>- When used with motion verbs like 行っている or 来ている it means that you "completed the motion, and now you exist in that state." |
| ～てある                                                     | - By replacing 「いる」 with 「ある」, instead of a continuing action, it becomes a resultant state after the action has already taken place. Usually, this expression is used to explain that something is in a state of completion. |
| ～ておく                                                     | - While 「～てある」 carries a nuance of a completed action in preparation for something else, 「～ておく」 explicitly states that the action is done (or will be done) with the future in mind. E.g.<br>晩ご飯を作っておく。<br>I make dinner (in advance for the future). |
| ～ていく<br>～てくる                                         | - When “to go” 行く or “to come” 来る is used with the te-form, to show that an action is oriented toward or from someplace. While 「持っている」 means you are in a state of holding something (in possession of), when the 「いる」 is replaced with 「いく」 or 「くる」, it means you are taking or bringing something. |
| 〜てはだめ<br>〜てはいけない<br>〜てはならない               | - Expresses things that must NOT be done<br>- いけない and ならない conjugate like i-adjectives but are not actual adjectives.<br>- Base for いけない is いける (行ける)<br>- Base for ならない is なる (成る)<br>ここに入ってはいけません。<br>"You must not enter here." |
| ~ても...                                                     | - Saying something is ok to do or not do<br>- Te-form and the 「も」 particle, you are essentially saying, “even if you do X…” Common words that come after this include いい, 大丈夫, or 構わない. E.g.<br>~てもいい<br>~ても大丈夫<br/>~ても構わない<br/>全部飲んでも構わないよ。<br>I don’t mind if you drink it all. (lit: Even if you drink it all, I don’t mind, you know.) |
| ~てみる                                                      | - To try something out<br>- Mnemonic: Sequence of an action and then seeing the result<br>- Conjugations happen on as always on 見る<br>お酒を飲んでみましたが、すごく眠くなりました。<br>I tried drinking alcohol and I became extremely sleepy. |
| 〜てあげる                                                   | - Express the giving of a favor (verb) you must use the ever useful te-form and then attach 「あげる」. See "Giving and receiving" |
| 〜てもらえる<br>〜てくれる                                   | - Make requests. See "Giving and receiving".                 |
| ~て欲しい                                                    | - When combined with the te-form of a verb, it means “to want something done”<br>部屋をきれいにしてほしいのよ。<br>It is that I want the room cleaned up, you know. |
| 〜*て*しまった                                               | - Express an action that is done or happened unintentionally.<br>毎日ケーキを食べて、２キロ太ってしまいました。<br>I ate cake everyday and I (unintentionally) gained two kilograms. |



## Masu-form stem usages

| ます-stem + addition | Explanation                                                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| stem + たい          | - means "want to", if negated "don't want to"<br>- たい is conjugated like an i-adjective, i.e. negative = たくない<br>温泉に行きたい。<br>I want to go to hot spring. |
| stem + ましょう      | - volitional form (polite)<br>- Same as "Volitional form (casual)" (see Unsorted Grammar Point), but formal |
| stem + なさい        | - Firm but polite requests. See "Making requests".           |
| stem + すぎる        | - When 「すぎる」 is attached to the end of other verbs and adjectives, it means that it is too much or that it has exceeded the normal levels. |

| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| stem + とする                          | - To attempt to do something<br>- You need to conjugate the verb into the volitional, enclose it in a quotation (so that we can perform an action on the clause) and finally add the verb する<br>毎日、勉強を避けようとする。<br>Everyday, she attempts to avoid study. |
|                                        |                                                              |

## Conditionals (if-then)

| Type             | Explanation                                                  |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| と               | - Natural consequence conditional. Simple if-then. E.g.<br>電気を消す*と*暗くなる。<br>"If you turn off the lights, it will get dark." |
| なら             | - Contextual conditional. You can use this particle to express what will happen given a certain context. A context must be present to use it.<br>- Attach なら to the context in which the conditional would occur. You must NOT attach the declarative だ.<br>みんなが行く*なら*私も行く。<br>"If given that everybody is going, then I’ll go too." |
| Conditional&nbsp;Form | - Conditional just expresses a regular “if” condition without any assumptions or embedded meanings.<br>- Uses conditional form.<br>楽しければ、私も行く。<br>"If it’s fun, I’ll go too." |
| たら / だら      | - Past tense + ら.<br>- Like the ば conditional, it is also a general conditional.<br>お金があったらいいね。<br>"If I had money, it would be good, huh?" |
|ば / たら + どう|- This literally means, “If you do [X], how is it?” In English, this would become, “How about doing [X]?”<br>銀行に行ったらどうですか。<br>How about going to bank?|
|もし|- NOT a conditional<br>- もし is a supplement to add a sense of uncertainty on whether the condition is true.<br>もしよかったら、映画を観に行きますか？<br>"If by any chance it’s ok with you, go to watch movie?"|



## Must / must not

| Japanese                                                     | Explanation                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Must NOT do<br>〜てはだめ<br>〜てはいけない<br>〜てはならない | - Expresses things that must NOT be done<br>- いけない and ならない conjugate like i-adjectives but are not actual adjectives.<br>- Base for いけない is いける (行ける)<br>- Base for ならない is なる (成る)<br>ここに入ってはいけません。<br>"You must not enter here." |
| Must be done                                                 | - Negative te-form + 「は」 (wa) particle + だめ／いけない／ならない<br>宿題をしなくてはいけなかった<br>Had to do homework.<br>- Negative verb + 「と」 conditional + だめ／いけない／ならない<br>宿題をしないといけない<br>Have to do homework.<br>- Negative verb + 「ば」 conditional + だめ／いけない／ならない<br>宿題を*しなければ*だめだった。<br>Had to do homework. |
| Must be done simplified                                      | - Simply replace 「なくて」 with 「なくちゃ」<br>勉強しなくちゃ。<br>Gotta study.<br>- Simply replace 「なければ」 with 「なきゃ」<br>ご飯を食べなきゃ。<br>Gotta eat.<br>- The 「と」 conditional is also used by itself to imply 「だめ／いけない／ならない」.<br>学校に行かないと。<br>Gotta go to school. |



## Relative clauses

| Japanese | Explanation                                                  |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| // todo  | we learned how to treat a relative clause like an adjective to directly modify a noun. が stuff and shit. https://github.com/jihadichan/jp/blob/master/ubersentences/grammarguide/items/170.md |
|adjective to modify a noun|If there are "qualifiers" before the subject, then it's a relative sentence. e.g. <br>学生だった人は... - Person who was a student...|
| direct&nbsp;quote          |- Directly quoting something that was said<br>- と added to the end of the quote.<br>アリスが、「寒い」と言った。<br>Alice said, “Cold”.|
|interpreted&nbsp;quote|- Quote along the lines of what someone actually said. It’s not a word-for-word quote. Works the same way as a direct way.<br>- Besides the standard “he said”, “she said”, we can perform the action, “to think” or “to hear” to produce phrases, e.g. “I think [clause]” or “I heard [clause]”<br>今、どこに行こうかと考えている。<br>Now, I’m considering where to set out to go.<br>- If the quoted relative clause is a state-of-being for a noun or na-adjective, you have to explicitly include the declarative 「だ」 to show this.<br>彼は高校生だと聞いたけど、信じられない。<br>I heard that he is a high school student but I can’t believe it.|
|casual quote|- Use って instead of と and drop the rest of the sentence<br>もうお金がないって。<br>I already told you I have no money.<br>-って can also be used to talk about practically anything. Most of the time it is used in place of the は particle to simply bring up a topic.|



## Defining and Describing

| Japanese | Explanation                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Define with<br>と言う                                        | - When you want to say how something is referred to<br>これは、なんという魚ですか。<br>What is this fish referred to as?<br>私はアリスといいます。<br>I am called Alice. (lit: As for me, you say Alice.) |
| Describe&nbsp;with<br>と言う                                 | - When a relative clause is encapsulated with 「と」, you must have a verb to go along with it and 「いう」 is simply being used as a generic verb to enable us to talk about any relative clause. This allows us to describe and explain just about anything.<br>リブートというのは、パソコンを再起動するということです。<br>Reboot means to restart your computer. |
| こう言う<br>そう言う<br>ああ言う<br>どう言う                 | - こういう - this way<br>- そういう - that way<br>- ああいう - that way (far away in an abstract sense)<br>- どういう - what way<br>あんたは、いつもこういう時に来るんだから、困るんだよ。<br>It’s because you always come at times like these that I’m troubled. |
| というか                                                     | - This construction is used when you want to rephrase or redefine something such as the following dialogue.<br>う～ん、彼女というか、友達というか、なんというか・・・<br>Um, you might say girlfriend, or friend, or something… |
| ということ                                                   | - Rather than using 「か」 to rephrase a conclusion, we can also simply use 「こと」 to sum up something without rephrasing anything.<br>ということは、みきちゃんは、今彼氏がいないということ？<br>Does that mean Miki-chan doesn’t have a boyfriend now? |
|って・て|- って is very often used in causal slang in place of と, because it allows us to leave out the rest of the sentence and assume context.<br>来年留学するというのは、智子のこと？<br>The studying abroad next year thing, is that Tomoko?<br>来年留学するって智子のこと？<br>The studying abroad next year thing, is that Tomoko?<br>- In some cases, the small つ is left out and just て is used instead of って.<br>ていうか、もう帰らないとだめですけど。<br>Rather than that, I have to go home already.|
|ゆう (also 言う)|- In conversations, it is quite normal to say 「ゆう」 instead of 「いう」.<br>そうゆうことじゃないって！<br>I said it’s not like that (lit: it’s not that type of thing)!|



## Giving and receiving

| Japanese | Explanation                                                  |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 上げる   | -「あげる」 is the Japanese word for “to give” seen from the speaker’s point of view.<br>これは先生にあげる。<br>I’ll give this to teacher.<br>- In order to express the giving of a favor (verb) you must use the ever useful te-form<br>代わりに行ってあげる。<br/>I’ll give you the favor of going in your place.<br>- For third-person, this verb is used when the speaker is looking at it from the giver’s point of view.<br>学生がこれを先生にあげる。<br>The student give this to teacher. (looking at it from the student’s point of view) |
| 遣る     | - Usually used for pets, animals, and such, you can substitute 「やる」, which normally means “to do”, for 「あげる」.<br>犬に餌をやった？<br/>Did you give the dog food?<br>- In order to ask for a favor you must use the ever useful te-form<br>車を買ってくれるの？<br>You’ll give me the favor of buying a car for me? |
| 暮れる   | - 「くれる」 is also a verb meaning “to give” but unlike 「あげる」, it is from the receiver’s point of view. You must use this verb when someone *else* is giving something or doing something for you<br>友達が私にプレゼントをくれた。<br>Friend gave present to me.<br>- Similarly, when used in the third-person, the speaker is speaking from the receiver’s point of view and not the giver.<br>先生がこれを学生にくれる。<br>The teacher give this to student. (looking at it from the student’s point of view) |
| 貰う     | - “to receive”<br>私が友達*に*プレゼントをもらった。<br>I received present from friend. |
|Asking&nbsp;favors|See "Making requests"|
|Asking not to do&nbsp;something|See "Making requests"|



## Making requests

- :heavy_exclamation_mark: NOTE: 「ください」 is a special conjugation of 「くださる」, which is the honorific form of 「くれる」. Because 「ください」 like the masu-form must always come at the end sentence or a relative clause, you cannot use it to directly modify a noun. But you can still use it inside a sentence if it's in a direct quote (see と)

| Japanese                                  | Explanation                                                  |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Asking&nbsp;favors                        | - You can make requests by using 「くれる」 and the potential form of 「もらう」 (can I receive the favor of…). by attaching it to the te-form of a verb<br>- It is not normal to explicitly include the subject and target like this:<br>あなたが、私に千円を貸してくれる？<br>Will you give me the favor of lending 1000 yen?<br>私が、あなたに千円を貸してもらえる？<br>Can I receive the favor of you lending 1000 yen?<br>- You can use the negative to make the request a little softer.<br>ちょっと静かにしてくれない？<br>Won’t you be a little quieter? |
| Asking not&nbsp;to&nbsp;do&nbsp;something | - In order to request that someone *not* do something, you simply attach 「で」 to the negative form of the verb and proceed as before.<br>高い物を買わないでくれる？<br>Can you not buy expensive thing(s)? |
| 〜をください<br>〜をくれる？<br>〜てくれ  | -「ください」here is a direct request for something while 「くれる」 is used as a question asking for someone to give something.<br>それをください。<br>Please give me that.<br>それをくれる？<br>Can you give me that?<br>- To sound particularly commanding and manly, remove the る.<br>日本語で話してくれ。<br/>Speak in Japanese. |
| 〜てください<br>〜ないでください          | - Direct polite request. Te-form + ください<br>漢字で書いてください。<br>Please write it in kanji.<br>- Negative request: Negative te-form + ください<br>ここにこないでください。<br>Please don’t come here. |
| ～ちょうだい<br>〜頂戴                    | - Casual request. A casual alternative of 「ください」. Has a slightly feminine and childish nuance and is always written in Hiragana. Grammatically, it’s used exactly the same way as 「ください」. |
| ～なさい                                  | - Firm but polite request. Used when a mother is scolding her child or when a teacher wants a delinquent student to pay attention.<br>- masu-stem + なさい<br>よく聞きなさい！<br>Listen well!<br>まだいっぱいあるから、たくさん食べな。<br>There’s still a lot, so eat a lot. |
| Imperative Form                           | - In reality, the command form is rarely used as Japanese people tend to be too polite to use imperatives.<br>- See imperative form conjugations<br>あっち行け！<br>Go away!<br>- Negative command form. Simply attach simply attach な to the base verb.<br>それを食べるな！<br>Don’t eat that! |



## Numbers and Counting

- The Japanese number system is spread into units of four. So a number such as 10,000,000 is actually split up as 1000,0000.
  - That's why they go from 10k to 100m to 1 trillion ...
  - Once you get past 1万 (10,000), you start all over until you reach 9,999万, then it rotates to 1億 (100,000,000).
- You can simply count from 1 to 99 with just these ten numbers. Japanese is easier than English in this respect because you do not have to memorize separate words such as “twenty” or “fifty”. In Japanese, it’s simply just “two ten” and “five ten”.

## Casual Patterns and Slang

- The fundamental goal of slang is to reduce mouth movement, example 1:
  ここ**はつまら**ないから私**の家に**行こう。
  ここ**つまん**ないから、私**んち**行こう。
  Example 2:
  **まった**く、いつまでこんな**ところ**で、ぐずぐず**するん**だよ。
  **った**く、　いつまでこんな**とこ**で、　ぐずぐず**すん**だよ。
- While written Japanese already has fairly loose rules regarding sentence order, casual spoken Japanese takes it one step further.
  Correct: それは何？
  Slang: 何それ？
- 「じゃん」 is an abbreviation of 「じゃない」, the negative conjugation for nouns and na-adjectives. 
  - Though derived from 「じゃない」, 「じゃん」 is always used to confirm the positive.
  - It can be attached to the end of any sentence regardless of whether it ends in a noun, adjective, verb, or adverb.
  - 「じゃん」 is basically saying something along the lines of, “See, I’m right, aren’t I?”
- Using 「つ」 for 「という」. This may sound hard to believe but if you really slur 「という」 together, it becomes something resembling 「つ」. E.g.
  だから、違うんだつうの！
  "Like I said, you’re wrong!"
  - If you want even more emphasis, you can even add a small 「つ」. This usually means you are really at the brink of your patience. E.g.
    だから、違うんだっつうの！
    "Like I said, you’re wrong!"
- 「ってば」 and 「ったら」 is yet another type of abbreviation for 「という」 similar to 「って」 as discussed in the defining and describing section.  In this case, it’s an abbreviation of the conditional form of 「という」, which is 「といえば」 and 「といったら」. By using this abbreviation, you are essentially saying something along the lines of, “If I told you once, I told you a million times!”
  もう行くってば！
  "I told you I’m going already!"
- In the case of 「何か」, while 「なにか」 is the correct reading, it is often contracted to just 「なんか」 in casual speech.
  - 「なんか」 also has a function similar to the word “like” in English. By “like”, I’m not talking about the actual word but the kind that has no meaning and some people use just about anywhere in the sentence. Similarly, 「なんか」 can also be used as a filler without any actual meaning. 
    今日は、なんか忙しいみたいよ。(なんか is just a filler word and can be left out)
    "I guess he’s like busy today."
- 「やがる」 is a verb suffix used to indicate hatred or contempt for the person doing the action. Strong language is not used in normal, everyday conversations. You simply attach it to the masu-stem of the verb. After that, 「やがる」 is conjugated just like a regular る-verb. 
  あんなやつに負けやがって。じゃ、どうすんだよ？
  "Losing to a guy like that. Well, what are you going to do?"
  - Stems maybe from 嫌がる (iyagaru, to dislike) ?



## Causative and Passive Verbs

| Japanese                        | Explanation                                                  |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Causative&nbsp;Verbs            | - The causative form (see verbs conjugation) can mean either making or letting  someone do something, i.e. “make someone do” and “let someone do”. The result is then conjugated like an -eる verb.<br>- When the causative form is used with 「あげる」 and 「くれる」, it almost always means to “let someone do”.<br>先生が質問をたくさん聞かせてくれた。<br>Teacher let (someone) ask lots of questions.<br>その部長は、よく長時間働かせる。<br/>That manager often makes (people) work long hours. |
| Shortened Causative Form        | - Instead of せる the ending becomes す, e.g. 行かせる -> 行かす<br>- If the causative form has a さ stem (e.g. iる & eる verbs), then it becomes さす, e.g. 食べさせる -> 食べさす<br>- 「する」 becomes 「さす」<br>- 「くる」 becomes 「こさす」<br>- The further conjugation is then that of す verbs |
| Passive Form                    | - The passive form 〜られる is used to express that something is done to somebody. Conjugation in that is that of -eる verbs<br>外国人に質問を聞かれたが、答えられなかった。<br>I was asked a question by a foreigner but I couldn’t answer.<br>- Using passive form is another more polite way to express an action<br>どうする？ – What will you do? (lit: How do?)<br/>どうしますか？ – Regular polite.<br/>どうされますか？- Passive polite. |
| Causative-Passive Forms         | - The causative-passive form is simply the combination of causative and passive conjugations to mean that the action of making someone do something was done to that person. This would effectively translate into, “[someone] is made to do [something]”. The important thing to remember is the order of conjugation. The verb is first conjugated to the causative and then passive, never the other way around. E.g. 食べる → 食べさせる → 食べさせられる<br>朝ご飯は食べたくなかったのに、食べさせられた。<br/>Despite not wanting to eat breakfast, I *was made to eat* it. |
| Shorter Causative-Passive Forms | - Going along with the shorter causative alternative, you can also use the same conjugation for the causative-passive form. The idea is to simply used the shortened causative form instead of using the regular causative conjugation.<br>行く → 行か → 行かす → 行かされる<br>- This form cannot be used in cases where the shorter causative form ends in 「さす」, in other words, you can’t have a 「さされる」 ending. I.e. this is WRONG:<br>食べ*る* → 食べ*さす* → 食べ~~さされる~~ |



## Honorific and Humble Forms

- The first thing to remember is that the speaker always considers himself/herself to be at the lowest level. So any actions performed by oneself are in humble form while actions performed by anyone else seen from the view of the speaker uses the honorific form.

## Expressing Amounts

| Japanese | Explanation                                                  |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| だけ     | - The particle 「だけ」 is used to express that that’s all there is. Just like the other particles we have already learned, it is directly attached to the end of whichever word that it applies to.<br>- Unlike some particles, you can directly attach 「だけ」 to verbs as well. |
| のみ     | - A particle that is essentially identical both grammatically and in meaning to 「だけ」 is 「のみ」. However, unlike 「だけ」, which is used in regular conversations, 「のみ」 is usually only used in a written context. |
| しか     | - 「しか」 must be used to indicate the lack of everything else. In other words, the rest of the sentence must always be negative.<br>- しか」 has an embedded negative meaning while 「だけ」 doesn’t have any particular nuance.<br>これだけ見る。<br>See just this.<br>これだけ見ない。<br>Don’t see just this.<br>これしか見ない。<br>Don’t see anything else but this. |
| っきゃ   | - 「っきゃ」 is another version of 「しか」 that means essentially the same thing and works exactly the same way. |
| ばかり   | - 「ばかり」 is used to express the condition where there’s so much of something to the point where there’s nothing else.<br>- In more casual situations, 「ばかり」 is usually pronounced 「ばっかり」 or just 「ばっか」. |
| すぎる   | - 「すぎる」 is a regular ru-verb written 「過ぎる」 meaning, “to exceed”.<br>- Verbs: masu-stem + すぎる<br>- na-adjectives: Just attach すぎる<br>- For negative verbs and adjectives: REPLACE last い with さ and attach すぎる.<br>- Most regular i-adjectives such as 「危ない」 or 「少ない」just REMOVE the い  and attach すぎる. |
| も       | - When the 「も」 particle comes after some type of amount, it means that the amount indicated is way too much.<br>昨日、電話三回もしたよ！<br>I called you like three times yesterday! |
| ほど     | The noun 「ほど」（程） is attached to a word in a sentence to express the extent of something. It can modify nouns as well as verbs.<br>今日の天気はそれほど暑くない。<br>Today’s weather is not hot to that extent. |
| ～さ     | - Add 「さ」 to adjectives to indicate an amount of that adjective. For example, we can attach 「さ」 to the adjective for “high” in order to get “height”.<br>- For i-adjectives, replace the い with さ.<br>- For na-adjectives just attach it. |
