## Video guides

- [Cure Dolly](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkdmU8hGK4Fg3LghTVtKltQ) - Weird, but actually good. Seems to be a linguist.

- [Nihongo no mori](https://www.youtube.com/c/nihongonomori2013) (in Japanese)

## Other stuff

- [Japanese Anki decks](https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks/japanese)
- [YomiChan](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/yomichan/ogmnaimimemjmbakcfefmnahgdfhfami). Get this now. Use with [AnkiConnect](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2055492159). For integration with Anki see [here](https://foosoft.net/projects/yomichan/#anki-integration). You can make vocab card with audio (`{audio}`) + screenshot (`{clipboard-image}`) with a single click. 
- [AniMelon](https://animelon.com/) - Bad tech but it's the only site with Japanese + English subtitles as text together 
- [LanguageReactor](https://www.languagereactor.com/) - Chrome extension for dual language subtitles. Works on YouTube and Netflix. Tried the previous version, was already good. Might be better now. Holy shit. Just tested it. It's really good. It uses auto-translations (which is really bad) but it's still fucking awesome.
