## Explanation

<p>1. <span class="cloze">もらう</span> is used as an auxiliary verb with Verbて. The meaning of Verbて<span class="cloze">もらう</span> is 'receive some benefit from someone's action' or 'have someone do something for someones sake'. Like sentences with <span class="cloze">もらう</span> as a main verb, when the auxiliary verb <span class="cloze">もらう</span> is used, the recipient of the favor (i.e., the person in the subject position) must be the first person or someone with whom the speaker empathizes (usually a member of the speaker's in-group). Thus, (1a) is grammatical, but (1b) is not.</p>  <ul>(1) <li>a. 私は隣の人にペンを貸して<span class="cloze">もらった</span>。</li> <li>Literally: I had the man next to me lend me a pen. (= I borrowed a pen from the man next to me.)</li> <div class="divide"></div> <li>b. *隣の人は私にペンを貸して<span class="cloze">もらった</span>。</li> <li>Literally: The man next to me had me lend him a pen. (= The man next to me borrowed a pen from me.)</li> </ul>  <p>Note that if the giver of the favor is the first person, sentences with Verbて<span class="cloze">もらう</span> are ungrammatical even if the recipient of the favor is someone the speaker empathizes with, as in (2).</p>  <p>(⇨ <a href="#㊦ もらう (1)">もらう1</a>, Note1)</p>  <ul>(2) <li>*弟は私にラジオを貸して<span class="cloze">もらった</span>。</li> <li>My younger brother had me lend him a radio.</li> </ul>  <p>The humble polite version of <span class="cloze">もらう</span> as an auxiliary verb is <span class="cloze">いただく</span>. Example:</p>  <ul>(3) <li>私は先生に本を貸して<span class="cloze">いただいた</span>。</li> <li>Literally: I had my teacher lend me a book. (= I borrowed a book from my teacher.)</li> </ul>  <p>4. Unlike sentences with もらう1, the giver cannot be marked by から in sentences with <span class="cloze">もらう</span>2.</p>  <p>5. In declarative sentences, if the subject is the speaker, it is often omitted. Similarly, in interrogative sentences, if the subject is the hearer, it is often omitted. (Key Sentence (A), (B) and Example (b).)</p>
