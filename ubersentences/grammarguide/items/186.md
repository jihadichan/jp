<p>1. <span class="cloze">ところ</span> itself means 'place', but it can also mean 'state' or 'time' when it is used with a modiiying verb, adjective or noun.</p>  <p>2. As seen in Key Sentence (A) - Key Sentence (D), verbs which precede <span class="cloze">ところ</span> are either past or nonpast and either progressive or non-progressive, and each one of the four verb forms expresses a different aspect of the action.</p>  <p>3. As seen in Key Sentence (E), when the preceding verb is nonpast and non-progressive and the following copula is in the past tense, the sentence may mean 'someone or something almost did something.' (The literal meaning is 'someone or something was about to do something.') When <span class="cloze">ところだった</span> means 'almost did something', such adverbs as もう少しで 'just by a little' and 危なく 'nearly' are often used also, as in Key Sentence (E) and Example (e).</p>  <p>4. <span class="cloze">ところ</span> can be followed by either the copula, as in Key Sentence (A) - Key Sentence (E), Examples (a) and (e), or such particles as を, に, へ and で, as in Key Sentence (F) and Key Sentence (G), Examples (b) - (d) and (f) - (h).</p>  <p>5. When adjectives or nouns with の precede <span class="cloze">ところ</span>, <span class="cloze">ところ</span> is usually followed by a particle rather than the copula, as in Examples (f) and (h). The following sentences are ungrammatical:</p>  <ul>(1) <li>a. *私は今忙しい<span class="cloze">ところです</span>。</li> <div class="divide"></div> <li>b. *私は今休みの<span class="cloze">ところです</span>。</li> </ul>  <p>【Related Expressions】</p>  <p>I. When <span class="cloze">ところ</span> is used as a dependent noun, its function appears to be similar to that of 時. However, these two expressions are different in that <span class="cloze">ところ</span> basically indicates a state, while 時 indicates a time. Thus, [1] makes sense by itself, but [2] does not.</p>  <p>[1]</p>  <ul> <li>僕は電話をかけるところだ。</li> <li>Literally: I'm in the state where I'm going to place a call. (= I'm just about to call someone.)</li> </ul>  <p>[2]</p>  <ul> <li>*僕は電話をかける時だ。</li> <li>*I am when I'm going to place a call.</li> </ul>  <p>II. Verbいる/いた<span class="cloze">ところだ</span> is similar to Verbいる/いた. The difference is that the former focuses more on the state or the scene while the latter concentrates on the action. Compare the usages of the two expressions in [3] and [4].</p>  <p>[3]</p>  <ul> <li>あ、ジョンが走っている/*走っている<span class="cloze">ところだ</span>。</li> <li>Look! John is running.</li> </ul>  <p>[4]</p>  <ul> <li>この写真は学生がフリスビーをしている<span class="cloze">ところです</span>/*しています。</li> <li>This picture shows students playing frisbee (literally: is a scene of students playing frisbee).</li> </ul>  <p>III. Verb informal past<span class="cloze">ところだ</span> is similar to Verb informal pastばかりだ. However, their implications are different. That is, the former indicates that someone/something is in the state of having just done something, while the latter implies that someone/something did something and not much time has passed since then. Thus, <span class="cloze">ところだ</span> is strange in [5] because 一週間前 'a week ago' is too far in the past to be used to express "have just done something".</p>   <p>[5]</p>  <ul> <li>私は山本先生には一週間前に会ったばかりだ/*<span class="cloze">ところだ</span>。</li> <li>I met Professor Yamamoto only a week ago.</li> </ul>
