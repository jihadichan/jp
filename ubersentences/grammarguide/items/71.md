## Explanation

<p>1. The meaning of Sentence1<span class="cloze">たら</span>Sentence2 varies depending on the contents of Sentence1 and Sentence2 and also on the situation in which this construction is used. However, Sentence always represents an antecedent and Sentence2 a subsequence. For example, in Key Sentence, Mr. Yamada's coming precedes the speaker's returning home. Likewise, in Example (a), the speaker's asking his teacher precedes his understanding something. If this relation does not hold, this construction cannot be used. For example, (1) cannot be expressed by the <span class="cloze">たら</span> construction because the event of Sentence1, the speaker's going to Chicago, does not precede the event of Sentence2, his going there by car.</p>  <ul>(1) <li>When I go to Chicago, I usually go by car.</li> <li>*私はシカゴへ行っ<span class="cloze">たら</span>たいてい車で行きます。</li> </ul>  <p>(In this situation, 時 is used. (⇨ <a href="#㊦ 時・とき">時</a>)) For the same reason, <span class="cloze">たら</span> is ungrammatical in the situation in (2).</p>  <ul>(2) <li>If you go to Chicago, go by bus.</li> <li>*シカゴへ行っ<span class="cloze">たら</span>バスで行きなさい。</li> </ul>  <p>(In this case, なら is used. (⇨ <a href="#㊦ なら">なら</a>))</p>  <p>2. In Sentence1<span class="cloze">たら</span>Sentence2, it is often the case that Sentence1 represents a condition and Sentence2 an event which occurs under that condition. Therefore, the whole sentence basically means 'when Sentence1 is satisfied, Sentence2 takes place' or 'Sentence1 brings about Sentence2', as in Examples (c), (d) and (e).</p>  <p>3. As seen in Key Sentence, <span class="cloze">たら</span> may mean 'when' in one case and 'if' in another. <span class="cloze">たら</span> means 'when' if Sentence1 is a certainty; if not, <span class="cloze">たら</span> means 'if'. Thus, in (3), <span class="cloze">たら</span> means 'when'.</p>  <ul>(3) <li>十二時になっ<span class="cloze">たら</span>帰ります。</li> <li>When/*If it is twelve o'clock, I'll go home.</li> </ul>  <p>もし before Sentence1<span class="cloze">たら</span> makes sentences unambiguous; it always means 'if Sentence1'. Example:</p>  <ul>(4) <li>もし山田さんが来<span class="cloze">たら</span>私は帰ります。</li> <li>If/*When Mr. Yamada comes, I'll go home.</li> </ul>  <p>4. In Sentence1<span class="cloze">たら</span>Sentence2, Sentence2 can be a command, a request, a suggestion, an invitation or a volitional sentence.</p>  <ul>(5)</ul>  <table class="table"> <tbody> <tr class="tr"> <td class="td"></td> <td class="td">⎧a. 来なさい。</td> </tr> <tr class="tr"> <td class="td"></td> <td class="td">⎪b. 来てください。</td> </tr> <tr class="tr"> <td class="td">仕事が早く終わっ<span class="cloze">らた</span>僕のうちに</td> <td class="td">⎨c. 来たらどうですか。</td> </tr> <tr class="tr"> <td class="td"></td> <td class="td">⎩d. 来ませんか。</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <table class="table"> <tbody> <tr class="tr"> <td class="td"></td> <td class="td">⎧a. come to my place.</td> </tr> <tr class="tr"> <td class="td"></td> <td class="td">⎪b. please come to my place.</td> </tr> <tr class="tr"> <td class="td">If you finish your work early, </td> <td class="td">⎨c. why don't you come to my place?</td> </tr> <tr class="tr"> <td class="td"></td> <td class="td">⎩d. wouldn't you like to come to my place?</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>  <ul>(6)  <li>仕事が早く終わっ<span class="cloze">たら</span>おうちにお伺いします。</li> <li>If I finish my work early, I'll visit your place.</li> </ul>  <p>5. Sentence1<span class="cloze">たら</span>Sentence2 can also be used in counterfactual situations, as in (7).</p>  <ul>(7) <li>a. お金があっ<span class="cloze">たら</span>こんなうちにはいない。</li> <li>If I had money, I wouldn't be in such a house.</li> <div class="divide"></div> <li>b.あの時お金があっ<span class="cloze">たら</span>日本へ行っていたでしょう。</li> <li>If I had had money at that time, I would probably have gone to Japan.</li> </ul>  <p>6. When Sentence2 in "Sentence1<span class="cloze">たら</span>Sentence2" represents a past action, the action cannot be one intentionally taken by the agent after the action or event represented by Sentence1. Thus, the (a) sentences in (8) and (9) are acceptable, but the (b) sentences are not.</p>  <ul>(8) <li>a. 学校へ行っ<span class="cloze">たら</span>、偶然上田さんに会った。</li> <li>When I went to school, I happened to see Mr. Ueda.</li> <div class="divide"></div> <li>b. *学校へ行っ<span class="cloze">たら</span>、上田さんと話をした。</li> <li>When I went to school, I talked with Mr. Ueda.</li> </ul>  <ul>(9)  <li>a. お酒を飲ん<span class="cloze">だら</span>寝てしまった。</li> <li>After I drank sake, I fell asleep.</li> <div class="divide"></div> <li>b. *お酒を飲ん<span class="cloze">だら</span>寝た。</li> <li>After I drank sake, I went to bed.</li> </ul>  <p>【Related Expressions】</p>  <p>ば, なら and と4 have similar functions but they are different trom <span class="cloze">たら</span> in the following ways:</p>  <p>I. In Sentence1<span class="cloze">たら</span>Sentence2, if the event in Sentence1 precedes the event in Sentence2, those events can be past events. This is also the case with Sentence1とSentence2, but not with Sentence1ばSentence2 and Sentence1ならSentence2, as in [1].</p>  <p>[1]</p>  <ul> <li>a. 先生に聞い<span class="cloze">たら</span>/聞くと/*聞けば/*聞いた(の)ならすぐ分かった。</li> <li>When I asked my teacher, I understood it immediately.</li> <div class="divide"></div> <li>b.キャシーのアパートに行っ<span class="cloze">たら</span>/行くと/*行けば/*行った(の)ならアンデイーがいた。</li> <li>When I went to Cathy's apartment, Andy was there.</li> </ul>  <p>II. As stated in Note 4, Sentence2 in Sentence1<span class="cloze">たら</span>Sentence2 can be a command, a request, a suggestion, an invitation or a volitional sentence. This is also the case with Sentence2 in Sentence1ばSentence2 and Sentence1ならSentence2 but not with Sentence2 in Sentence1とSentence2. Example:</p>  <p>[2]</p>  <ul> <li>問安かっ<span class="cloze">たら</span>/安ければ/安い(の)なら/*安いと買いなさい。</li> <li>Buy it, if it's cheap.</li> </ul>  <p>II. Although Sentence2 in Sentence1<span class="cloze">たら</span>Sentence2, Sentence1ばSentence2 and Sentence1ならSentence2 can be a command a request, a suggestion, an invitation or a volitional sentence, the meanings are not exactly the same. The following examples show the differences clearly.</p>  <p>[3]</p>  <ul> <li>a. ベンが来<span class="cloze">たら</span>、私は帰ります。</li> <li>When/If Ben comes, I'll go home.</li> <div class="divide"></div> <li>b. ベンがくれば、私は帰ります。</li> <li>If Ben comes, I'll go home. (If not, I'll stay here.)</li> <div class="divide"></div> <li>c. ベンが来る(の)なら、私は帰ります。</li> <li>It it is true that Ben is coming, I'll go home.</li> </ul>  <p>As seen above, [3a] is ambiguous; it is not clear that Ben is coming. If Ben's coming is certain, [3a] indicates the time the speaker will leave. If Ben's coining is uncertain, [3a] indicates the condition under which the speaker will leave. In both cases, however, Ben's coming precedes the speaker's leaving. [3b] is similar to the second case of [3a] (i.e., the case in which Ben's coming is uncertain). However, [3b] focuses more on the condition. That is, [3b] implies something like 'the condition under which I go home is Ben's coming here'. In [3b] also, Ben's coming precedes the speaker's leaving. Sentence1 in [3c] also indicates the condition under which the speaker returns home. In this case, however, Ben's coming does not necessarily precede the speaker's leaving because the condition under which the speaker goes home is that Ben's coming !s true, not that Ben comes (to a certain place).</p>  <p>IV. As stated in Note 5, Sentence1<span class="cloze">たら</span>Sentence2 can be used in counterfactual situations, and so can Sentence1ばSentence2 and Sentence1ならSentence2. However, Sentence1とSentence2 cannot be used in such situations except for the idiomatic expression Sentenceといい/よかった 'It would be good/It would have been good if Sentence'. Example:</p>  <p>[4]</p>  <ul> <li>あの時お金があっ<span class="cloze">たら</span>/あれば/あったなら/*あると日本に行っていただろう。</li> <li>If I had had money at that time, I would have gone to Japan.</li> </ul>
