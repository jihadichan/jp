<tr><td>父があと1年生きていてくれたら私の結婚式に出てもらえたものを、私がぐずぐずしていたばかりに、父に私の晴れ姿を見てもらえず、とても残念です。<td><tr><tr><td>Had my father lived one year longer, he could have attended my wedding ceremony, but just because I was indecisive for so long, I couldn't give him the chance to see me in my wedding dress. I feel so sorry!<td><tr></table>
