## Explanation

<p>1. When Y is the subject of a clause, X to indicates that X and Y have a reciprocal relationship. For example, in Example (a), the fact that Tom often plays tennis with John necessarily means that John often plays tennis with Tom; in other words, it means that they have a reciprocal relationship. Thus, <span class="cloze">と</span> often corresponds to the English 'with', as in 'in the company of'. <span class="cloze">と</span> also appears with such reciprocal verbs and adjectives as 結婚する 'marry', 喧嘩する 'quarrel', 話し合う 'discuss with', 似る 'resemble', 違う 'differ' and 同じだ 'be the same'. (See Examples (b), (c) and (d).)</p>  <p>2. In reciprocal sentences, the subject and X in X to are interchangeable. For example, Example (b) can be restated as in (1).</p>  <ul>(1) <li>みどりは一郎<span class="cloze">と</span>結婚した。</li> <li>Midori married Ichiro.</li> </ul>  <p>Example (b) is described from Ichiro's point of view, while (1) is described from Midori's point of view.</p>   <p>(⇨ <a href="#㊦ と (1)">と1</a>, Related Expression I)</p>  <p>【Related Expression】</p>  <p>Some reciprocal expressions take Xに or X<span class="cloze">と</span> depending on the meaning, as in [1] and [2].</p>  <p>[1]</p>  <ul> <li>a. 正男は先生<span class="cloze">と</span>話した。</li> <li>Masao talked with his teacher.</li> <div class="divide"></div> <li>b. 正男は先生に話した。</li> <li>Masao talked to his teacher.</li> </ul>  <p>[2]</p>  <ul> <li>a. 明は君子<span class="cloze">と</span>打つかった。</li> <li>Akira bumped into Kimiko.</li> <div class="divide"></div> <li>b. 明は君子に打つかった。</li> <li>Akira bumped into Kimiko.</li> </ul>  <p>The difference is that <span class="cloze">と</span> implies a "bidirectional" action while に implies a "unidirectional" one. For example, [2a] implies that both Akira and Kimiko were moving, whereas in [2b] only Akira was moving. Thus, <span class="cloze">と</span> is unacceptable in [3] because 柱 'post' is immobile.</p>  <p>[3]</p>  <ul> <li>明は柱に/*<span class="cloze">と</span>打つかった。</li> <li>Akira bumped into a post.</li> </ul>
