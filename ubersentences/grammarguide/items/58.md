## Explanation

<p>から commonly describes a movement towards a place where the speaker physically exists, as in Key Sentence and Example (d). However, it can also describe a movement in a direction where the speaker has placed his viewpoint or where he feels strong empathy. For example, in Example (a) the speaker, who apparently did not attend the party, is taking the viewpoint of the hearer, who did attend. In Example (c) the speaker is phoning and is not at the hearer's house, yet he is taking the hearer's viewpoint, a typical example of the psychological fusion between speaker and hearer. In Example (b), it is possible that the speaker lives nearer Nagoya than Mr. Kiguchi does and feels that Mr. Kiguchi is entering his (the speaker's) territory or area of strong empathy. And again, in Example (e), the use of <span class="cloze">来る</span> indicates that the speaker's office as well as his house can be considered his territory or area of empathy.</p>  <p>【Related Expression】</p>  <p>If a movement is towards a place where the speaker can place his viewpoint, <span class="cloze">来る</span> is used, but if a movement is towards a place where the speaker cannot place his viewpoint, 行く is used.</p>  <p>(⇨ <a href="#㊦ 行く・いく (1)">行く</a>1)</p>  <p>In Examples (a) and (c) both <span class="cloze">来る</span> and 行く are acceptable. The difference is that the use of <span class="cloze">来る</span> shifts the focus of the sentence to the hearer's viewpoint while 行く shifts it to the speaker's viewpoint.</p>
