<p>1. <span class="cloze">が</span> marks the subject of a sentence when the information expressed by the subject is first introduced in a discourse. When the subject is presented as the topic (that is, the information has already been introduced into the discourse), however, the topic marker は replaces <span class="cloze">が</span>. (⇨ <a href="#㊦ は (1)">は1</a>) Consider the following discourse, a typical opening in folktales, which illustrates the different uses of <span class="cloze">が</span> and は.</p>  <ul>(1) <li>昔々一人のおじいさん<span class="cloze">が</span>住んでいました。おじいさんはとても貧乏で した。</li> <li>Once upon a time there lived an old man. He (literally: the old man) was very poor.</li> </ul>  <p>In the first sentence, おじいさん 'old man' appears for the first time in the discourse; おじいさん is the subject but not the topic in this sentence. Therefore, it is marked by <span class="cloze">が</span>. The second sentence tells something about the old man introduced in the first sentence. おじいさん is now the topic; therefore, it is marked by は rather than <span class="cloze">が</span>. Note the parallelism here between <span class="cloze">が</span> and は in Japanese and 'a' and 'the' in English.</p>  2. <span class="cloze">が</span> is also replaced by は if the subject is in contrast with another element. For example, in Example (c), B could also say:</p>  <ul>(2) <li>ステーキは美味しいです。</li> <li>Steak is good (but other food is not)./(I don't know about other food but at least) Steak is good.</li> </ul>  <p>Here, ステーキ 'steak' is newly introduced in the discourse and is not the topic; yet it is marked by は. This is because ステーキ, in this case, is being contrasted with other food.</p>  <p>3. Since Interrogative words like 何 'what', 誰 'who' and どこ 'what place' can never be topics, they are never marked by は, as in (3).</p>  <ul>(3) <li>今晩誰<span class="cloze">が</span>/*は来ますか。</li> <li>Who is coming tonight?</li> </ul>  <p>4. The subject in subordinate clauses is marked by <span class="cloze">が</span> unless it is a contrasted element, as seen in (4).</p>  <ul>(4) <li>a. 私はデビー<span class="cloze">が</span>/*はフランスへ行くことを知らなかった。</li> <li>I didn't know that Debbie was going to France.</li> <div class="divide"></div> <li>b. ジーンは僕<span class="cloze">が</span>/*はアパートを出た時まだ寝ていた。</li> <li>Gene was still in bed when I left my apartment.</li> <div class="divide"></div> <li>c. 私<span class="cloze">が</span>/*はきのう見た映画はドイツの映画だった。</li> <li>The movie I saw yesterday was a German film.</li> </ul>  <p>Note that topics are not presented in subordinate clauses.</p>  <p>3. In relative clauses, the subject may be marked by の, as in (5).</p>  <p>(⇨ <a href="#㊦ Relative Clause">Relative Clause</a>, Note 3)</p>  <ul>(5) <li>私のきのう見た映画はドイツの映画だった。</li> <li>The movie I saw yesterday was a German film.</li> </ul>  <p>6. In some expressions, elements which are considered to be direct objects are presented as subjects and are marked by <span class="cloze">が</span>.</p>   <p>(⇨ <a href="#㊦ は～が">は~が</a>)</p>  <ul>(6) <li>a.僕はスポーツカー<span class="cloze">が</span>欲しい。</li> <li>I want a sports car. (Literally: To me, a sports car is desirable.)</li> <div class="divide"></div> <li>b.春子はスペイン語<span class="cloze">が</span>分かる。</li> <li>Haruko understands Spanish. (Literally: To Haruko, Spanish is understandable.)</li> </ul>  <p>7. To sum up the important rules concerning <span class="cloze">が</span>,</p>  <ul> <li>(A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="cloze">が</span> marks the subject when it is newly introduced in a discourse.</li> <div class="divide"></div> <li>(B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;は replaces <span class="cloze">が</span> when the subject is a topic or a contrasted element.</li> <div class="divide"></div> <li>(C)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interrogative words are always marked by <span class="cloze">が</span> when they are the subject of a sentence.</li> <div class="divide"></div> <li>(D)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The subject in subordinate clauses is marked by <span class="cloze">が</span> unless it is a contrasted element.</li> <div class="divide"></div> <li>(E)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When predicates are transitive adjectives or stative transitive verbs, the elements which correspond to the direct object in English are marked by <span class="cloze">が</span>.</li> </ul>  <p>【Related Expression】</p>  <p>The topic marker は is often mistaken for a subject marker. It appears to be a subject marker because it often replaces <span class="cloze">が</span>.</p>  <p>(⇨ <a href="#㊦ は (1)">は1</a>)</p>
