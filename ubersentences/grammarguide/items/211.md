## Explanation

<p>The choice of the tense of the verb before <span class="cloze">だけ</span> depends on (1) whether or not the action expressed by the verb (Action 1) was taken in the past, and (2) whether or not the action/event expressed by the verb (Action 1) precedes the action/event expressed by the main verbal (Action 2). If A1 precedes A2 and A1 is a past action, the verb must be in the past tense (example, Key Sentence (B) and Example (e)). If A1 precedes A2 and A1 is not a past action, the verb is commonly in the nonpast tense, although the past tense is also acceptable (example, Examples (f) - (h)). If A1 does not precede A2 and A1 is a past action, the verb is commonly in the nonpast, although the past tense is also acceptable (example, Example (d)). If A1 does not precede A2 and A1 is not a past action, the verb must be in the nonpast (example, Key Sentence (A) and Examples(a) - (c)).</p>  <p>(⇨ <a href="http://bunpou.neocities.org/基本basic.html#㊦ だけ">だけ</a>㊦)</p>
