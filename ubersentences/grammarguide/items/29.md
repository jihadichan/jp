## Explanation

<p>1. The polite version of <span class="cloze">どう</span> is いかが. In very informal speech ですか is omitted after <span class="cloze">どう</span> or いかが.</p>  <p>2. <span class="cloze">どう</span> and いかが are also used to offer or suggest something, as in Examples (b) and (c). In this case, <span class="cloze">どう</span> or いかが are asking about the state of the hearer's mind regarding the offer or suggestion rather than about the state of what is being offered or suggested.</p>  <p>3. <span class="cloze">どう</span> is also used to ask the way of doing something. In this case, いかが is usually not used. Example:</p>  <ul>(1) <li>この言葉は<span class="cloze">どう</span>読みますか。</li> <li>How do you read this word?</li> </ul>  <p>4. The idiomatic expression <span class="cloze">どう</span>して 'literally: doing what' is used to ask manners, reasons or causes. Examples:</p>  <ul>(2) <li><span class="cloze">どう</span>して日本語を勉強しているんですか。</li> <li>How (= In what way) are you studying Japanese?/Why are you studying Japanese?</li> </ul>  <ul>(3) <li>この木は<span class="cloze">どう</span>して枯れたんですか。</li> <li>Why did this tree die?</li> </ul>  <p>As seen in (2), unless the context is clear, <span class="cloze">どう</span>して is sometimes ambiguous. (The interrogative adverb なぜ 'why' is unambiguous but less colloquial than <span class="cloze">どう</span>して.)</p>
