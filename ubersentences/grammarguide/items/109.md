## Explanation

<p>1. Because the main verbs used in the Key Sentences and the Examples, such as 悲しむ 'sadden', 喜ぶ 'rejoice', 恐れる 'fear', 懐かしむ nostalgically recollect' and 悩む 'worry' are all inwardly-oriented psychological verbs they cannot be considered transitive verbs in Japanese. Therefore, the particle <span class="cloze">を</span>4 preceding these verbs cannot be the ordinary direct object marker を which normally marks an outwardly-oriented event. Rather it indicates the cause for human emotion expressed by the main verb. Thus, it is sometimes possible to rewrite the sentence in question using ので 'because'. (⇨ <a href="#㊦ ので">ので</a>) For example, Key Sentence (A) and Example (a) can be paraphrased as (1a) and (1b), respectively.</p>  <ul>(1) <li>a. 次郞は父が死んだので悲しんだ。</li> <li>Jiro was sad because his father died.</li> <div class="divide"></div> <li>b. 私は浩が大学に入学したので喜んだ。</li> <li>I was glad because Hiroshi entered college.</li> </ul>  <p>The original versions are examples of written style and are seldom used in conversational Japanese, but the rewritten versions can be used in both spoken and written Japanese.</p>  <p>2. No matter what person (first, second, third) the subject of this construction is, the main emotive verb is normally in the stative ているい/ない form and/or in the past tense. In a generic statement, however, the verb can be in the non-stative, nonpast form as in (2):</p>  <ul>(2) <li>誰でも親の死<span class="cloze">を</span>悲しむ。</li> <li>Everybody is saddened by their parents' death.</li> </ul>  <p>3. If the emotive verb consists of adjective い stem + suffixむ as in 悲しむ 'sadden', 懐かしむ 'nostalgically recollect', 惜しむ 'regret', 楽しむ 'enjoy', it can take the suffix がる 'show signs of ~' as in 悲しがる, 懐かしがる, 惜しがる and 楽しがる. Thus, along with Key Sentence (A) we have a sentence type (3).</p>   <p>(⇨ <a href="#㊦ がる">がる</a>)</p>  <ul>(3) <li>次郞は父の死<span class="cloze">を</span>悲しがった。</li> <li>Jiro showed signs of being sad about his father's death.</li> </ul>  <p>(3) is a more objective expression than Key Sentence (A), because the verb がる 'show signs of ~' has an outwardly-oriented meaning.</p>
