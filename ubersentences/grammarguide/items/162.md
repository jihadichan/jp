## Explanation

<p>1. <span class="cloze">自分</span>1 is an empathy marker that normally refers back to the subject of the main clause as in Key Sentence (A), Examples (a), (b) and (c), or to the discourse topic as in Key Sentence (B) and Example (d).</p>  <p>2. When <span class="cloze">自分</span> is an empathy marker, its referent (i.e., the subject of the sentence) is normally a passive experiencer. In other words, the referent is not an agent (i.e., someone who initiates and/or completes an action).</p>  <p>(⇨ <a href="#㊦ 自分・じぶん (2)">自分2</a>)</p>  <p>3. Example (c) is an ambiguous sentence, because <span class="cloze">自分</span> can refer to either the main subject Michiko or to Kazuo. <span class="cloze">自分</span>'s reference to Kazuo is not a counter example of <span class="cloze">自分</span>'s strong tendency to refer to the subject, however, because Kazuo is semantically the subject of the verb 行く 'go'. Also to be noted is that Michiko is an agent of the causative action, but Kazuo is a passive experiencer of the causative action. Indeed，it is easier to look at Kazuo as the object of the speaker's empathy, because he is a passive experiencer. It is very likely that <span class="cloze">自分</span> is not an empathy marker but a contrastive marker when it refers to an agent Michiko. Other similar ambiguous sentences follow:</p>  <ul>(1) <li>a. 道子は一男に<span class="cloze">自分</span>の車で行ってもらった。</li> <li>Literally: Michiko received from Kazuo a favor of going there in her/his own car. ( = Michiko had Kazuo go there in her/his own car.)</li> <div class="divide"></div> <li>b. 道子は一男に<span class="cloze">自分</span>の車で行かれた。</li> <li>Literally: Michiko is annoyed by the fact that Kazuo went there by her/his own car. ( = Michiko had Kazuo go there in her/his own car.)</li> </ul>  <p>Note that <span class="cloze">自分</span> in (1a, b) is an empathy marker when it refers to Michiko and is a contrastive marker when it refers to Kazuo.</p>  <p>(⇨ <a href="#㊦ 自分・じぶん (2)">自分2</a>)</p>  <p>4. The referent of <span class="cloze">自分</span> in a complex sentence has to be conscious of the situation expressed in the main clause. Compare (2a) and (2b):</p>  <ul>(2) <li>a. 友子は<span class="cloze">自分</span>が死ぬ前に子供が大学に入った。</li> <li>Literally: Speaking of Tomoko, before she (Literally: herself) died, her child entered college. (= Before Tomoko died, her child entered college.)</li> <div class="divide"></div> <li>b. *友子は<span class="cloze">自分</span>が死んだあとで子供が大学に入った。</li> <li>Literally: Speaking of Tomoko, after she (Literally: herself) had died, her child entered college. (= After Tomoko died, her child entered college.)</li> </ul>  <p>The sentence (2b) is ungrammatical because one can hardly empathize with a dead person.</p>
