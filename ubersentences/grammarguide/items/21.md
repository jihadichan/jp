## Explanation

<p>1. In conversation, <span class="cloze">のだ</span>/<span class="cloze">です</span> often becomes <span class="cloze">んだ</span>/<span class="cloze">です</span>. In informal speech, male speakers use <span class="cloze">んだ</span> and female speakers use <span class="cloze">の</span>. (For the informal forms of <span class="cloze">のだ</span> in interrogative sentences, see <a href="#㊦ かい">かい</a> and <a href="#㊦ だい">だい</a>.)<p>  <p>2. Basically, Sentence<span class="cloze">のだ</span> is used when the speaker is explaining or asking for an explanation about information shared with the hearer. The information is often what the speaker and the hearer have observed or heard. For example, in Key Sentences, A uses <span class="cloze">のです</span> because he is asking for an explanation about what he sees B doing. B also uses <span class="cloze">のです</span> because he is explaining his actions. In this situation, (1) is odd.<p>  <ul>(1) <li>A: 何をしていますか。</li> <li>What are you doing?</li> <div class="divide"></div> <li>B: 日本語を勉強しています。</li> <li>I'm studying Japanese.</li> </ul>  <p>If, however, A is only assuming that B is doing something, A can ask the question in (2), and B can answer as B does in (1).<p>  <ul>(2) <li>あなたは今何をしていますか。</li> <li>What are you doing now?</li> </ul>  <p>In Example (a), as in Key Sentence, A uses <span class="cloze">んです</span> because A observes that B isn't drinking sake and wants an explanation for that. And, B also uses <span class="cloze">んです</span> because he is explaining about what A observed. In Example (b), the speaker uses <span class="cloze">んです</span> in the second sentence because it is an explanation about the information which has been given in the first sentence.<p>  <p>3. Sentence<span class="cloze">のだ</span> is also used when no information is shared by the speaker and the hearer and the speaker is not explaining or asking for an explanation about anything. In this case, the speaker is talking as if some information were shared with the hearer and the effects of this are, for example,<p>  <ul>(A) <li>to involve the hearer in the affairs he is talking about (See (3) and (4) below.),</li> </ul>  <ul>and/or</ul>  <ul>(B) <li>to impose his idea upon the hearer or, at least, to emphasize his idea emotively. (See (5) below.)</li> </ul>  <p>Examples:  <ul>(3)  <li>今日フットボールがある<span class="cloze">んです</span>が一緒に行きませんか。</li> <li>There is a football game today. Wouldn't you like to go (together) with me?</li> </ul>  <ul>(4) <li>先生、困っている<span class="cloze">んです</span>。助けてください。</li> <li>Teacher, I'm in trouble. Please help me.</li> </ul>  <ul>(5) <li>日本語の文法は難しいですがおもしろい<span class="cloze">んです</span>よ。</li> <li>Japanese grammar is difficult, but it is interesting, you know.</li> </ul>
