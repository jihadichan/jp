## Explanation

<p>1. <span class="cloze">やはり</span> is a speaker-oriented adverb because its use is based on the speaker's subjective and presuppositional standards. Its overuse in conversation makes a discourse overly subjective, but its proper use in conversation makes a discourse sound like real Japanese.</p>  <p>2. <span class="cloze">やはり</span> can be positioned sentence-initially or sentence-medially, just like other adverbs. Thus, in Key Sentence <span class="cloze">やはり</span> can be positioned in two ways.</p>  <ul>(1) <li>a. <span class="cloze">やはり</span>ベイリーさんは来なかったね。</li> <div class="divide"></div> <li>b. ベイリーさんは<span class="cloze">やはり</span>来なかったね。</li> <div class="divide"></div> <li>c. ?ベイリーさんは来なかったね，<span class="cloze">やはり</span>。</li> </ul>  <p>The sentence-initial <span class="cloze">やはり</span> is more emphatic than the sentence-medial <span class="cloze">やはり</span>. The sentence-final <span class="cloze">やはり</span> as in (1c) sounds like an after-thought, and its usage is slightly marginal.</p>  <p>3. <span class="cloze">やっぱり</span> is a more emphatic and emotive version of <span class="cloze">やはり</span>, owing to its glottal stop '<span class="cloze">っぱ</span>'.</p>  <p>【Related Expressions】</p>  <p>I. さすが is an adverb/adjective な whose meaning is similar to <span class="cloze">やはり</span>. さすが, however, has only one meaning 'as expected' and indicates that the speaker is very much impressed or surprised by the given situation.</p>  <p>[1]</p>  <ul> <li>a. さすが(に)日本人はよく働く。</li> <li>Truly Japanese people work hard!</li> <div class="divide"></div> <li>b.さすが(に)アメリカは広い。</li> <li>Exactly as I expected, America is huge.</li> </ul>  <p>さすが(に) can replace <span class="cloze">やはり</span> only when <span class="cloze">やはり</span> means 'as expected', as in Key Sentence and Example (c).</p>  <p>II. The adverb 結局 'after all, in short' can replace <span class="cloze">やはり</span> only when the latter means 'after all', as in Example (d). More examples follow:</p>  <p>[2]</p>  <ul> <li>a. 色々薬を飲んだがやはリ/結局治らなかった。</li> <li>I took all kinds of medicine, but I wasn't cured.</li> <div class="divide"></div> <li>b.やはリ/結局行かないことにした。</li> <li>After all, I decided not to go there.</li> </ul>  <p>In [2] 結局 sounds more formal than <span class="cloze">やはり</span>, because the former is a Sino-Japanese word, while the latter is a Japanese word. Yet both can be used in conversational Japanese.</p>   <p>III. The adverb まさか 'by no means, on no account, surely not' is used when a given situation is far from the speaker's expectation. In that sense, it is an antonym of <span class="cloze">やはり</span>. まさか is used with a negative predicate or is used all by itself, meaning 'Unbelievable!, You don't say!'.</p>  <p>[3]</p>  <ul> <li>a. まさか小川さんが先生になるとは思わなかった。</li> <li>I never expected Mr. Ogawa to become a teacher.</li> </ul>  <ul>b.  <li>A: トムが入院したそうだ。</li> <li>I heard that Tom was hospitalized.</li> <div class="divide"></div> <li>B: まさか！　きのうテニスをしていたよ。</li> <li>You don't say! He was playing tennis yesterday.</li> </ul>
