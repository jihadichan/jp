<p>1. Some of the uses of <span class="cloze">で</span>3 (such as Key Sentence and Example (a)) are very close to the て form of です. For example, Key Sentence can be paraphrased into two sentences (1a) and (1b):</p>  <ul>(1) <li>a. 山口さんは病気でした。</li> <li>Mr. Yamaguchi was ill.</li> <div class="divide"></div> <li>b. 山口さんは学校を休みました。</li> <li>Mr. Yamaguchi was absent from school.</li> </ul>  <p>And Key Sentence can be considered to be the result of combining the two sentences using the て form of です which basically means 'be ~and'.</p>  <p>2. A noun that precedes <span class="cloze">で</span>3 expresses something that is beyond human control (such as illness, flood, accident, rain, and fire). It is also to be noted that <span class="cloze">で</span>3 co-occurs with any noun, if a predicate expresses something that is beyond human control. If the co-occurring predicate expresses something that is controllable, the particle <span class="cloze">で</span> is no longer <span class="cloze">で</span>3; it is で2 of means. (⇨ <a href="#㊦ で (2)">で2</a>) Compare (2a) and (2b) below:</p>  <ul>(2) <li>a. 卵<span class="cloze">で</span>アレルギーになる。</li> <li>Literally: Eggs cause me allergy. (= I'm allergic to eggs.)</li> <div class="divide"></div> <li>b. 卵でオムレツを作る。</li> <li>I make an omelette with eggs.</li> </ul>  <p>(2a) and (2b) contain a noncontrollable predicate アレルギーになる 'become allergic' and a controllable predicate オムレツを作る 'make an omelette', respectively. Therefore, <span class="cloze">で</span> in (2a) and (2b) are <span class="cloze">で</span>3 and で2, respectively.</p>  <p>【Related Expression】</p>  <p>The particle <span class="cloze">で</span>3 is a very loose marker of cause due to its origin; in contrast, から3 and ので are clear subordinate conjunctions of cause/reason.</p>  <p>(⇨ <a href="#㊦ から (3)">から3</a>; <a href="#㊦ ので">ので</a>)</p>
