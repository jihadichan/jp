## Explanation

<p>When a sentence involves the verb 登る 'climb', there is an important difference between the use of the particle <span class="cloze">を</span> and that of に, as seen in (1).</p>  <ul>(1) <li>a. ドンは東京タワー<span class="cloze">を</span>登った。</li> <li>Don scaled Tokyo Tower.</li> <div class="divide"></div> <li>b. ドンは東京タワーに登った。</li> <li>Don went up Tokyo Tower.</li> </ul>  <p>【Related Expression】</p>  <p>The particle で1 also marks the space in wmch an action takes place. The difference between で1 and <span class="cloze">を</span> is that で1 can be used with any action verb, while <span class="cloze">を</span> can be used only with motion verbs such as 歩く 'walk', 走る 'run', 飛ぶ 'fly' and 泳ぐ 'swim'. Thus, <span class="cloze">を</span> is ungrammatical in [1].</p>  <p>[1]</p>  <ul> <li>私は図書館で/*<span class="cloze">を</span>勉強した。</li> <li>I studied at the library.</li> </ul>  <p>When either で1 or <span class="cloze">を</span> is possible, as in [2], there is usually a subtle difference between them.</p>  <p>[2]</p>  <ul> <li>ジョンは川で/<span class="cloze">を</span>泳いだ。</li> <li>John swam in the river.</li> </ul>  <p>First, when で1 is used, other locations for an action are also implied, but when <span class="cloze">を</span> is used, there are no such implications. For example, in [3] John has a choice between a pool and the river. Here, で1 is acceptable, but <span class="cloze">を</span> is not.</p>  <p>[3]</p>  <ul> <li>ジョンはプールが嫌いだからたいてい川で/*<span class="cloze">を</span>泳ぐ。</li> <li>John usually swims in the river because he doesn't like pools.</li> </ul>  <p>Second, when で1 is used, the sentence often indicates that the purpose of the action is the action itselt, whereas when <span class="cloze">を</span> is used it seems that there is another purpose behind the action. For example, in [4] John swam in order to escape, and swimming was not the purpose of his action. Therefore, <span class="cloze">を</span> is acceptable but で1 is not.</p>  <p>[4]</p>  <ul> <li>ジョンは川<span class="cloze">を</span>/*で泳いで逃げた。</li> <li>John escaped by swimming in the river.</li> </ul>
