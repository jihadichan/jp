## Explanation

<p>1. In this construction the sentence preceding <span class="cloze">ね</span> can be any informal or formal sentence except nonpolite imperative. Thus,</p>  <ul>(1) <li>a. *読め<span class="cloze">ね</span>。</li> <li>Read it, will you?</li> <div class="divide"></div> <li>b. 読みなさい<span class="cloze">ね</span>。 </li> <li>Read it, will you?</li> <div class="divide"></div> <li>c. 読んでください<span class="cloze">ね</span>。</li> <li>Please read it, will you?</li> </ul>  <p>2. <span class="cloze">ね</span> can be used as a request for either confirmation or agreement from the addressee. When a sentence expresses the speaker's strong impression of something, <span class="cloze">ね</span> indicates the speakers request for agreement from the hearer, as in Example (a). When a sentence expresses something emotively neutral, <span class="cloze">ね</span> indicates the speaker's request for confirmation from the hearer, as in Key Sentence and Examples (b) and (c). Here, however, Key Sentence can also be a request for agreement, if the speaker is surprised that Mr. Sakamoto doesn't smoke. These two uses of <span class="cloze">ね</span> have diflferent intonations: the <span class="cloze">ね</span> of agreement uses falling intonation and the <span class="cloze">ね</span> of confirmation uses rising intonation. The <span class="cloze">ね</span> of agreement becomes <span class="cloze">ねえ</span> if the speaker is excited about the content of his statement. In other words, Sentence<span class="cloze">ねえ</span> is an exclamatory sentence, as in (2).</p>  <ul>(2) <li>A: 面白い映画でした<span class="cloze">ねえ</span>！</li> <li>It was such an interesting film, wasn't it!</li> <div class="divide"></div> <li>B:そうでした<span class="cloze">ねえ</span>！</li> <li>Wasn't it!</li> </ul>  <p>On the other hand, the <span class="cloze">ね</span> of confirmation has no exclamatory overtones; it implies something like 'I am assuming X but can you confirm it?' Thus, in Key Sentence the speaker doesn't like people who smoke, and for some reason or other, he wants to confirm that Mr. Sakamoto is not one of those people.</p>  <p>3. <span class="cloze">ね</span> is sometimes used in a non-sentence-final position to draw the hearer's attention to something or to confirm that the hearer has understood what has been said up to that point. <span class="cloze">ね</span> is typically used in this manner in telephone conversations.</p>  <ul>(3) <li>もしもし、今晩<span class="cloze">ね</span>、銀座で飲んでから帰るから<span class="cloze">ね</span>、十一時半頃になるよ。</li> <li>Literally: Hello, tonight, OK? I go home after drinking in Ginza, you understand?, so I'll be home around 11:30. </li> <li>= Hello, tonight I'll go to Ginza to drink, so I'll be home around 11:30.</li> </ul>  <p>4. {て/から}<span class="cloze">ね</span> is specifically used to give a reason or a cause for the speaker's state of mind or feelings in a very indirect and vague fashion. Examples follow:</p>  <ul>(4) <li>a. あの先生はとてもきびしくて/きびしいから<span class="cloze">ね</span>。</li> <li>(It's because) that teacher is very strict, you know?</li> <div class="divide"></div> <li>b. ゆうべは飲みすぎて/飲みすぎたから<span class="cloze">ね</span>。</li> <li>(It's because) I drank too much last night, you know?</li> </ul>  <p><span class="cloze">ね</span> here indicates the speaker's request for agreement from the hearer based on shared knowledge.</p>  <p>5. The <span class="cloze">ね</span> of confirmation or agreement is used after another sentence-final particle よ of assertion. よ<span class="cloze">ね</span> means 'I assert that ~ but don't you agree?/am I right?'. This <span class="cloze">ね</span> is pronounced with rising intonation</p>  <ul>(5) <li>a. 英語が分かるよ<span class="cloze">ね</span>。</li> <li>Literally: I assert that you understand English but am I right? (= You understand English, don't you?)</li> <div class="divide"></div> <li>b. あの先生はいい先生ですよ<span class="cloze">ね</span>。</li> <li>That teacher is a good teacher. Don't you think so?</li> </ul>  <p>6. The <span class="cloze">ね</span> of confirmation or agreement is used after another sentence-final particle, the question marker か. か<span class="cloze">ね</span> means 'I am not sure if ~, am I right?'. The <span class="cloze">ね</span> of か<span class="cloze">ね</span> is pronounced with falling intonation.</p>  <ul>(6) <li>a. 山下君は京大に入れますか<span class="cloze">ね</span>。</li> <li>Literally: I'm not sure whether Mr. Yamashita can get into Kyoto University, but am I right? </li> <li>= I'm not sure whether Mr. Yamashita can get into Kyoto University. What do you say?</li> <div class="divide"></div> <li>b. あの先生はいい先生ですか<span class="cloze">ね</span>。</li> <li>I doubt that he is a good teacher.</li> </ul>
