There is some argument against calling this an adverb at all but it is convenient for us to do so because of the grouping of i-adjectives and na-adjectives. Thinking of it as an adverb, we can interpret the sentence to mean: “Alice did her room cleanly.” or less literally: “Alice cleaned her room.” （「きれい」 literally means “pretty” but if it helps, you can think of it as, “Alice prettied up her own room.”）<br>- 139 Basic Grammar - Using Adverbs and Gobi: Properties of Adverbs<br>#<ruby>自分<rt>じぶん</rt></ruby>:<ul><li>myself; yourself; oneself; himself; herself<div class=""info"">(Pronoun)</div></li></ul><br>#<ruby>綺麗<rt>きれい</rt></ruby><div class='ofrms'><div>oFrms</div><div><ruby>奇麗<rt>きれい</rt></ruby></div><div><ruby>暉麗<rt>きれい</rt></ruby></div><div><ruby>キレイ</ruby></div></div>:<ul><li>pretty; lovely; beautiful; fair<div class=""info"">(Na-adjective; usu. written as kana)</div></li><li>clean; clear; pure; tidy; neat<div class=""info"">(usu. written as kana)</div></li></ul><br>#<ruby>に</ruby>:<ul><li>to (direction, state); toward; into</li></ul>"	139 Basic Grammar - Using Adverbs and Gobi: Properties of Adverbs	taekim/1581266292524-アリスは自分の部屋をきれいにした.mp3	%5B%7B%22surface%22%3A%22%E3%82%A2%E3%83%AA%E3%82%B9%22%2C%22pos%22%3A0%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%222603%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%226246%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E5%90%8D%E8%A9%9E%22%2C%22%E5%9B%BA%E6%9C%89%E5%90%8D%E8%A9%9E%22%2C%22%E4%BA%BA%E5%90%8D%22%2C%22%E5%90%8D%22%5D%7D%2C%7B%22surface%22%3A%22%E3%81%AF%22%2C%22pronunciation%22%3A%22%E3%83%AF%22%2C%22pos%22%3A3%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%222%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%224%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E5%8A%A9%E8%A9%9E%22%2C%22%E4%BF%82%E5%8A%A9%E8%A9%9E%22%5D%7D%2C%7B%22surface%22%3A%22%E8%87%AA%E5%88%86%22%2C%22reading%22%3A%22%E3%82%B8%E3%83%96%E3%83%B3%22%2C%22pos%22%3A4%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%2297%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%22445%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E5%90%8D%E8%A9%9E%22%2C%22%E4%B8%80%E8%88%AC%22%5D%7D%2C%7B%22surface%22%3A%22%E3%81%AE%22%2C%22pos%22%3A6%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%223%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%221%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E5%8A%A9%E8%A9%9E%22%2C%22%E9%80%A3%E4%BD%93%E5%8C%96%22%5D%7D%2C%7B%22surface%22%3A%22%E9%83%A8%E5%B1%8B%22%2C%22reading%22%3A%22%E3%83%98%E3%83%A4%22%2C%22pos%22%3A7%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%22278%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%221622%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E5%90%8D%E8%A9%9E%22%2C%22%E4%B8%80%E8%88%AC%22%5D%7D%2C%7B%22surface%22%3A%22%E3%82%92%22%2C%22pos%22%3A9%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%226%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%225%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E5%8A%A9%E8%A9%9E%22%2C%22%E6%A0%BC%E5%8A%A9%E8%A9%9E%22%2C%22%E4%B8%80%E8%88%AC%22%5D%7D%2C%7B%22surface%22%3A%22%E3%81%8D%E3%82%8C%E3%81%84%22%2C%22pos%22%3A10%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%22578%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E5%90%8D%E8%A9%9E%22%2C%22%E5%BD%A2%E5%AE%B9%E5%8B%95%E8%A9%9E%E8%AA%9E%E5%B9%B9%22%5D%7D%2C%7B%22surface%22%3A%22%E3%81%AB%22%2C%22pos%22%3A13%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%225%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%222%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E5%8A%A9%E8%A9%9E%22%2C%22%E6%A0%BC%E5%8A%A9%E8%A9%9E%22%2C%22%E4%B8%80%E8%88%AC%22%5D%7D%2C%7B%22surface%22%3A%22%E3%81%97%22%2C%22baseForm%22%3A%22%E3%81%99%E3%82%8B%22%2C%22conjugationForm%22%3A%22%E9%80%A3%E7%94%A8%E5%BD%A2%22%2C%22conjugationType%22%3A%22%E3%82%B5%E5%A4%89%E3%83%BB%E3%82%B9%E3%83%AB%22%2C%22pos%22%3A14%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%229%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%223%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E5%8B%95%E8%A9%9E%22%2C%22%E8%87%AA%E7%AB%8B%22%5D%7D%2C%7B%22surface%22%3A%22%E3%81%9F%22%2C%22conjugationForm%22%3A%22%E5%9F%BA%E6%9C%AC%E5%BD%A2%22%2C%22conjugationType%22%3A%22%E7%89%B9%E6%AE%8A%E3%83%BB%E3%82%BF%22%2C%22pos%22%3A15%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%224%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E5%8A%A9%E5%8B%95%E8%A9%9E%22%5D%7D%2C%7B%22surface%22%3A%22%E3%80%82%22%2C%22pos%22%3A16%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E8%A8%98%E5%8F%B7%22%2C%22%E5%8F%A5%E7%82%B9%22%5D%7D%5D

今日、知りました。	"I found out about it today. (I did the action of knowing today.)<br> -「知る」 means “to know”. English is weird in that “know” is supposed to be a verb but is actually describing a state of having knowledge. Japanese is more consistent and 「知る」 is just a regular action verb. In other words, I “knowed” (action) something and so now I know it (state). That’s why the English word “to know” is really a continuing state in Japanese, namely: 「知っている」.<br>- 080 Essential Grammar - Other uses of the te-form - Enduring state of being rather than enduring state of action<br>#<ruby>知る<rt>しる</rt></ruby>:<ul><li>to be aware of; to know; to be conscious of; to cognize; to cognise<div class=""info"">(Godan verb with ru ending; Transitive verb)</div></li><li class=""np""><span class=""ofrms"">Other Forms　<ruby>識る<rt>しる</rt></ruby></span></li></ul>"	080 Essential Grammar - Other uses of the te-form - Enduring state of being rather than enduring state of action	taekim/1581266292552-今日知りました.mp3	%5B%7B%22surface%22%3A%22%E4%BB%8A%E6%97%A5%22%2C%22pronunciation%22%3A%22%E3%82%AD%E3%83%A7%E3%83%BC%22%2C%22reading%22%3A%22%E3%82%AD%E3%83%A7%E3%82%A6%22%2C%22pos%22%3A0%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%22147%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%221331%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E5%90%8D%E8%A9%9E%22%2C%22%E5%89%AF%E8%A9%9E%E5%8F%AF%E8%83%BD%22%5D%7D%2C%7B%22surface%22%3A%22%E3%80%81%22%2C%22pos%22%3A2%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E8%A8%98%E5%8F%B7%22%2C%22%E8%AA%AD%E7%82%B9%22%5D%7D%2C%7B%22surface%22%3A%22%E7%9F%A5%E3%82%8A%22%2C%22baseForm%22%3A%22%E7%9F%A5%E3%82%8B%22%2C%22conjugationForm%22%3A%22%E9%80%A3%E7%94%A8%E5%BD%A2%22%2C%22conjugationType%22%3A%22%E4%BA%94%E6%AE%B5%E3%83%BB%E3%83%A9%E8%A1%8C%22%2C%22reading%22%3A%22%E3%82%B7%E3%83%AA%22%2C%22pos%22%3A3%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%2274%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%22146%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E5%8B%95%E8%A9%9E%22%2C%22%E8%87%AA%E7%AB%8B%22%5D%7D%2C%7B%22surface%22%3A%22%E3%81%BE%E3%81%97%22%2C%22baseForm%22%3A%22%E3%81%BE%E3%81%99%22%2C%22conjugationForm%22%3A%22%E9%80%A3%E7%94%A8%E5%BD%A2%22%2C%22conjugationType%22%3A%22%E7%89%B9%E6%AE%8A%E3%83%BB%E3%83%9E%E3%82%B9%22%2C%22pos%22%3A5%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%2218%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E5%8A%A9%E5%8B%95%E8%A9%9E%22%5D%7D%2C%7B%22surface%22%3A%22%E3%81%9F%22%2C%22conjugationForm%22%3A%22%E5%9F%BA%E6%9C%AC%E5%BD%A2%22%2C%22conjugationType%22%3A%22%E7%89%B9%E6%AE%8A%E3%83%BB%E3%82%BF%22%2C%22pos%22%3A7%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%224%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E5%8A%A9%E5%8B%95%E8%A9%9E%22%5D%7D%2C%7B%22surface%22%3A%22%E3%80%82%22%2C%22pos%22%3A8%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E8%A8%98%E5%8F%B7%22%2C%22%E5%8F%A5%E7%82%B9%22%5D%7D%5D

This is usually decided by context and common practices. see http://www.guidetojapanese.org/learn/grammar/teform<br>- 082 Essential Grammar - Other uses of the te-form - Enduring state of being rather than enduring state of action<br>#<ruby>道<rt>みち</rt></ruby>:<ul><li>road; path; street; lane; passage<div class=""info"">(Noun)</div></li><li>route; way</li><li class='np'><span class='ofrms'>Other Forms　<ruby>途<rt>みち</rt></ruby>、<ruby>路<rt>みち</rt></ruby>、<ruby>径<rt>みち</rt></ruby></span></li></ul>"	082 Essential Grammar - Other uses of the te-form - Enduring state of being rather than enduring state of action	taekim/1581266292552-道は分かりますか.mp3	%5B%7B%22surface%22%3A%22%E9%81%93%22%2C%22reading%22%3A%22%E3%83%9F%E3%83%81%22%2C%22pos%22%3A0%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%22485%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%22149%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E5%90%8D%E8%A9%9E%22%2C%22%E4%B8%80%E8%88%AC%22%5D%7D%2C%7B%22surface%22%3A%22%E3%81%AF%22%2C%22pronunciation%22%3A%22%E3%83%AF%22%2C%22pos%22%3A1%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%222%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%224%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E5%8A%A9%E8%A9%9E%22%2C%22%E4%BF%82%E5%8A%A9%E8%A9%9E%22%5D%7D%2C%7B%22surface%22%3A%22%E5%88%86%E3%81%8B%E3%82%8A%22%2C%22baseForm%22%3A%22%E5%88%86%E3%81%8B%E3%82%8B%22%2C%22conjugationForm%22%3A%22%E9%80%A3%E7%94%A8%E5%BD%A2%22%2C%22conjugationType%22%3A%22%E4%BA%94%E6%AE%B5%E3%83%BB%E3%83%A9%E8%A1%8C%22%2C%22reading%22%3A%22%E3%83%AF%E3%82%AB%E3%83%AA%22%2C%22pos%22%3A2%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%2248%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%221458%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E5%8B%95%E8%A9%9E%22%2C%22%E8%87%AA%E7%AB%8B%22%5D%7D%2C%7B%22surface%22%3A%22%E3%81%BE%E3%81%99%22%2C%22conjugationForm%22%3A%22%E5%9F%BA%E6%9C%AC%E5%BD%A2%22%2C%22conjugationType%22%3A%22%E7%89%B9%E6%AE%8A%E3%83%BB%E3%83%9E%E3%82%B9%22%2C%22pos%22%3A5%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%2218%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E5%8A%A9%E5%8B%95%E8%A9%9E%22%5D%7D%2C%7B%22surface%22%3A%22%E3%81%8B%22%2C%22pos%22%3A7%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%2217%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%2241%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E5%8A%A9%E8%A9%9E%22%2C%22%E5%89%AF%E5%8A%A9%E8%A9%9E%EF%BC%8F%E4%B8%A6%E7%AB%8B%E5%8A%A9%E8%A9%9E%EF%BC%8F%E7%B5%82%E5%8A%A9%E8%A9%9E%22%5D%7D%2C%7B%22surface%22%3A%22%E3%80%82%22%2C%22pos%22%3A8%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E8%A8%98%E5%8F%B7%22%2C%22%E5%8F%A5%E7%82%B9%22%5D%7D%5D

鈴木さんはどこですか。／もう、家に帰っている。	"Where is Suzuki-san? / He is already at home (went home and is there now).<br>- probably like てある (i.e. completed action) but with animate object (i.e. いる)<br>- It is reasonable to assume the actions 「行っている」 and 「来ている」 would mean, “going” and “coming” respectively. But unfortunately, this is not the case. The 「～ている」 form of motion verbs is more like a sequence of actions we saw in the last section. You completed the motion, and now you exist in that state. (Remember, 「いる」 is the verb of existence of animate objects.)

鉛筆を持っている？	"Do (you) have a pencil?<br>- like ""are you processing a pen""<br>- You can also use the motion verbs “to go” （行く）and “to come” （来る） with the te-form, to show that an action is oriented toward or from someplace.

今日は晴れて、富士山が見える。	"It cleared up today and Fuji-san is visible.<br>- 見える is already the potential form of 見る. Jisho claims that there is a potential form of the potential form, but that's crap: https://japanese.stackexchange.com/a/43883 - wait... 見られる is the potential form of 見る, because it's an iru verb.<br>- THIS: There are two verbs 「見える」 and 「聞こえる」 that mean that something is visible and audible, respectively. When you want to say that you can see or hear something, you’ll want to use these verbs.

食べたくなかった<br>食べさせられた<br><br>朝ご飯は食べたくなかったのに、食べさせられた。	Despite not wanting to eat breakfast, I was made to eat it.<br> - The causative-passive form is simply the combination of causative and passive conjugations to mean that the action of making someone do something was done to that person.

~せざるを得ない<br><br>上司の話を聞くと、どうしても海外に出張をせざるを得ないようです。	"Hearing the story from the boss, it seems like I can't not go on a business trip overseas no matter what.<br>- This grammar is used when there’s something that just can’t be helped and must be done.  It uses the negative of the verb 「得る」 or “obtain”, to roughly mean that “one cannot obtain not doing of an action”. This means that you can’t not do something even if you wanted to.<br>- This grammar uses an archaic negative form of verbs that ends in 「～ざる」. It is really not used in modern Japanese with the exception of this grammar and some expressions such as 「意図せざる」. The rules for conjugation are the same as the negative verbs, except this grammar attaches 「ざる」 instead. To reiterate, all you have to do is conjugate the verb to the negative form and then replace the 「ない」 with 「ざる」. The two exception verbs are 「する」 which becomes 「せざる」 and 「くる」 which becomes 「こざる」. Finally, all that’s left to be done is to attach 「を得ない」 to the verb.<br> #<ruby>ざるを得ない<rt>ざるをえない</rt></ruby>:<ul><li>cannot help (doing); have no choice but to; am compelled to; am obliged to; it is

休日であろうが、なかろうが、この仕事では関係ないみたい。	Whether it's a holiday or not, it looks like it doesn't matter for this job.<br>- We learned in the lesson about formal grammar that 「ではない」 was the negative of 「である」. So how would we say something like 「であろう」 but for the negative?<br> - The conjugation rule is simple: remove the last 「い」 and attach 「かろう」.
