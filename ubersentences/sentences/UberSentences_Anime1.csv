あの人マジでチャラい。<br>チャラチャラしないで。<br>チャラ男	"That guy is seriously a player. Stop being so shallow.<br>- チャラい is an adjective to describe a person (usually men) as shallow and flirtatious. It usually refers to men who are players and constantly try to pick up girls. The word チャラい is used in different forms. One of the forms is チャラ男 (ちゃらお) which means the same as チャラい, but limited to only boys. The other form  is チャラチャラ(ちゃらちゃら), which comes from the sound that accessories make. Thus, the blings imply that one is shallow and superficial.<br>#<ruby>チャラい</ruby>:<ul><li>flashy; gaudy; wrapped in cheap flattery<div class=""info"">(I-adjective)</div></li><li class='np'><span class='ofrms'>Other Forms　<ruby>ちゃらい</ruby></span></li></ul><br>#<ruby>チャラ男<rt>チャラお</rt></ruby>:<ul><li>shallow playboy; frivolous lad; good-time Charlie<div class=""info"">(Noun)</div></li><li class='np'><span class='ofrms'>Other Forms　<ruby>ちゃら男<rt>ちゃらお</rt></ruby></span></li></ul><br>#<ruby>チャラチャラ</ruby>:<ul><li>coquettish; tawdry; flirty; flashy; flighty; jittery; superficial<div class=""info"">(Adverb taking the 'to' particle; Suru verb; Noun; Onomatopoeic or mimetic word)</div></li><li class='np'><span class='ofrms'>Other Forms　<ruby>ちゃらちゃら</ruby></span></li></ul>"	https://www.fluentu.com/blog/japanese/japanese-slang-words-phrases/	anime1/1603310417980-あの人マジでチャラいチャラチャラしないで.mp3	%5B%7B%22surface%22%3A%22%E3%81%82%E3%81%AE%22%2C%22pos%22%3A0%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%2278%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%225240%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E9%80%A3%E4%BD%93%E8%A9%9E%22%5D%7D%2C%7B%22surface%22%3A%22%E4%BA%BA%22%2C%22reading%22%3A%22%E3%83%92%E3%83%88%22%2C%22pos%22%3A2%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%2268%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%2225%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E5%90%8D%E8%A9%9E%22%2C%22%E4%B8%80%E8%88%AC%22%5D%7D%2C%7B%22surface%22%3A%22%E3%83%9E%E3%82%B8%22%2C%22pos%22%3A3%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%22490%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E5%90%8D%E8%A9%9E%22%2C%22%E5%BD%A2%E5%AE%B9%E5%8B%95%E8%A9%9E%E8%AA%9E%E5%B9%B9%22%5D%7D%2C%7B%22surface%22%3A%22%E3%81%A7%22%2C%22baseForm%22%3A%22%E3%81%A0%22%2C%22conjugationForm%22%3A%22%E9%80%A3%E7%94%A8%E5%BD%A2%22%2C%22conjugationType%22%3A%22%E7%89%B9%E6%AE%8A%E3%83%BB%E3%83%80%22%2C%22pos%22%3A5%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%2292%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%2210%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E5%8A%A9%E5%8B%95%E8%A9%9E%22%5D%7D%2C%7B%22surface%22%3A%22%E3%83%81%E3%83%A3%E3%83%A9%22%2C%22pos%22%3A6%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%2210008%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E5%90%8D%E8%A9%9E%22%2C%22%E5%9B%BA%E6%9C%89%E5%90%8D%E8%A9%9E%22%2C%22%E4%BA%BA%E5%90%8D%22%2C%22%E4%B8%80%E8%88%AC%22%5D%7D%2C%7B%22surface%22%3A%22%E3%81%84%22%2C%22pos%22%3A9%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%22167%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E5%90%8D%E8%A9%9E%22%2C%22%E4%B8%80%E8%88%AC%22%5D%7D%2C%7B%22surface%22%3A%22%E3%80%82%22%2C%22pos%22%3A10%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E8%A8%98%E5%8F%B7%22%2C%22%E5%8F%A5%E7%82%B9%22%5D%7D%2C%7B%22surface%22%3A%22%E3%83%81%E3%83%A3%E3%83%A9%E3%83%81%E3%83%A3%E3%83%A9%22%2C%22pos%22%3A11%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E5%90%8D%E8%A9%9E%22%2C%22%E3%82%B5%E5%A4%89%E6%8E%A5%E7%B6%9A%22%5D%7D%2C%7B%22surface%22%3A%22%E3%81%97%22%2C%22baseForm%22%3A%22%E3%81%99%E3%82%8B%22%2C%22conjugationForm%22%3A%22%E6%9C%AA%E7%84%B6%E5%BD%A2%22%2C%22conjugationType%22%3A%22%E3%82%B5%E5%A4%89%E3%83%BB%E3%82%B9%E3%83%AB%22%2C%22pos%22%3A17%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%229%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%223%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E5%8B%95%E8%A9%9E%22%2C%22%E8%87%AA%E7%AB%8B%22%5D%7D%2C%7B%22surface%22%3A%22%E3%81%AA%E3%81%84%22%2C%22conjugationForm%22%3A%22%E9%80%A3%E7%94%A8%E3%83%87%E6%8E%A5%E7%B6%9A%22%2C%22conjugationType%22%3A%22%E7%89%B9%E6%AE%8A%E3%83%BB%E3%83%8A%E3%82%A4%22%2C%22pos%22%3A18%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%2214%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%226815%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E5%8A%A9%E5%8B%95%E8%A9%9E%22%5D%7D%2C%7B%22surface%22%3A%22%E3%81%A7%22%2C%22pos%22%3A20%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%2213%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%229%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E5%8A%A9%E8%A9%9E%22%2C%22%E6%8E%A5%E7%B6%9A%E5%8A%A9%E8%A9%9E%22%5D%7D%2C%7B%22surface%22%3A%22%E3%80%82%22%2C%22pos%22%3A21%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E8%A8%98%E5%8F%B7%22%2C%22%E5%8F%A5%E7%82%B9%22%5D%7D%5D
別れよう。お前重すぎる。/ テストの事考えたら、気が重くなった。	"Let’s break up. You’re too much for me. / Thinking about test made me feel depressed.<br>- 重い literally means heavy and can be used in two different ways. The first way is to describe a person in a relationship. It is a negative word and connotes that this person is simply “too much” – whether that means s/he is constantly complaining, demanding, expecting too much or is obsessive. <br>- The second way to use 重い is when you describe something (a situation, feeling, words) as serious, uncomfortable, or depressing.<br>#<ruby>気が重い<rt>きがおもい</rt></ruby>:<ul><li>depressed; bummed out; down; heavy-hearted;

ウザい	"- short for うるさい<br>This is the short, slangy form of the adjective うるさい (urusai), which means to be “annoyingly noisy.” When it’s shortened to ウザイ, though, it takes on a bit of a stronger meaning like “what a pain” or “pain in the ass.” (Although not as rude as using that phrase in English.) It can also be used to describe someone gloomy, with an Eeyore-like personality from Winnie the Pooh.

リア充	"This is an interesting slang term because it acknowledges just how deep we’ve gone into the digital era. We don’t have a term like this in English! リア充 means is a portmanteau word for “real world”, リアルワールド (riaru wa-rudo), and “satisfied”, 充実 (juujitsu).<br><br>It’s used to describe people who would rather be out in the real world, enjoying life. Or, who are satisfied with their real life rather than an online persona.

W<br>笑い	"Yes, just “w.” It’s the Japanese equivalent of “lol” in English text slang. Why “w?” Because the word for “laugh” is 笑い (warai), so it starts with “w.” If you wanted to say “haha” though, you’d use the kanji itself, usually in parenthesis.

ぐぐる	Like in English, “Google” has become a verb. To say you’re “googling it,” you use ぐぐる in Japanese. There’s also the text shorthand, GGRKS. It means ググレカス (gugurekasu), and means “Google it yourself, scum.” It’s a bit harsh, to say the least, but you’ll see it on the internet.	https://www.fluentin3months.com/japanese-slang/	anime1/1603310417984-ぐぐる.mp3	%5B%7B%22surface%22%3A%22%E3%81%90%E3%81%90%E3%82%8B%22%2C%22pos%22%3A0%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E5%90%8D%E8%A9%9E%22%2C%22%E4%B8%80%E8%88%AC%22%5D%7D%5D

乙<br>お疲れ様でした	"This obscure kanji, which translates as “moth,” is now used as a shorthand for お疲れ様でした, which we talked about earlier. Why 乙? Because it’s read as おつ, which is the same slang term we covered above that means “you must be tired” or “thanks for your hard work.” You’ll see this as praise for someone online.

555<br>888	Another one based on how it sounds read aloud in Japanese. The number 5 in Japanese is ご (go). So when writing 555, you’re saying “Go, go, go!” It’s used in online gaming primarily. But it’s not the only number you’ll see pop up as internet slang! 888 is also used because it’s read はちはちはち (hachi hachi hachi), which is the onomatopoeia sound for clapping.	https://www.fluentin3months.com/japanese-slang/	xxx	%5B%7B%22surface%22%3A%22555%22%2C%22pos%22%3A0%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E5%90%8D%E8%A9%9E%22%2C%22%E6%95%B0%22%5D%7D%2C%7B%22surface%22%3A%22+%22%2C%22pos%22%3A3%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E8%A8%98%E5%8F%B7%22%2C%22%E7%A9%BA%E7%99%BD%22%5D%7D%2C%7B%22surface%22%3A%22%28%22%2C%22pos%22%3A4%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E5%90%8D%E8%A9%9E%22%2C%22%E3%82%B5%E5%A4%89%E6%8E%A5%E7%B6%9A%22%5D%7D%2C%7B%22surface%22%3A%22%E3%83%AD%E3%83%BC%E3%83%9E%E5%AD%97%22%2C%22reading%22%3A%22%E3%83%AD%E3%83%BC%E3%83%9E%E3%82%B8%22%2C%22pos%22%3A5%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%229520%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E5%90%8D%E8%A9%9E%22%2C%22%E4%B8%80%E8%88%AC%22%5D%7D%2C%7B%22surface%22%3A%22%29%22%2C%22pos%22%3A9%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E5%90%8D%E8%A9%9E%22%2C%22%E3%82%B5%E5%A4%89%E6%8E%A5%E7%B6%9A%22%5D%7D%5D
こｎ / んｐ / うｐ	- こｎ is short for こんばんは<br>- んｐ is the same as English “np”<br>- うp is short for “upload.”<br><br>Those three look like typos, don’t they? But they’re not typos at all! They’re abbreviated slang terms. こｎ is short for こんばんは, or “hello.” The romanized “n” is basically laziness because to get the ん character, you have to press the key an extra time. So they leave it as the romanized “n.”<br><br>As for the other two, んｐ is the same as English “np” which means “no problem.” And うp is short for “upload.”	https://www.fluentin3months.com/japanese-slang/	xxx	%5B%7B%22surface%22%3A%22%E3%81%93%22%2C%22pos%22%3A0%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%221497%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E5%90%8D%E8%A9%9E%22%2C%22%E4%B8%80%E8%88%AC%22%5D%7D%2C%7B%22surface%22%3A%22%EF%BD%8E%22%2C%22pos%22%3A1%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E8%A8%98%E5%8F%B7%22%2C%22%E3%82%A2%E3%83%AB%E3%83%95%E3%82%A1%E3%83%99%E3%83%83%E3%83%88%22%5D%7D%2C%7B%22surface%22%3A%22+%22%2C%22pos%22%3A2%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E8%A8%98%E5%8F%B7%22%2C%22%E7%A9%BA%E7%99%BD%22%5D%7D%2C%7B%22surface%22%3A%22%2F%22%2C%22pos%22%3A3%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E5%90%8D%E8%A9%9E%22%2C%22%E3%82%B5%E5%A4%89%E6%8E%A5%E7%B6%9A%22%5D%7D%2C%7B%22surface%22%3A%22+%22%2C%22pos%22%3A4%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E8%A8%98%E5%8F%B7%22%2C%22%E7%A9%BA%E7%99%BD%22%5D%7D%2C%7B%22surface%22%3A%22%E3%82%93%22%2C%22pos%22%3A5%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%2220%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%222394%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E5%90%8D%E8%A9%9E%22%2C%22%E9%9D%9E%E8%87%AA%E7%AB%8B%22%2C%22%E4%B8%80%E8%88%AC%22%5D%7D%2C%7B%22surface%22%3A%22%EF%BD%90%22%2C%22pos%22%3A6%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%224432%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E8%A8%98%E5%8F%B7%22%2C%22%E3%82%A2%E3%83%AB%E3%83%95%E3%82%A1%E3%83%99%E3%83%83%E3%83%88%22%5D%7D%2C%7B%22surface%22%3A%22+%22%2C%22pos%22%3A7%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E8%A8%98%E5%8F%B7%22%2C%22%E7%A9%BA%E7%99%BD%22%5D%7D%2C%7B%22surface%22%3A%22%2F%22%2C%22pos%22%3A8%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E5%90%8D%E8%A9%9E%22%2C%22%E3%82%B5%E5%A4%89%E6%8E%A5%E7%B6%9A%22%5D%7D%2C%7B%22surface%22%3A%22+%22%2C%22pos%22%3A9%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E8%A8%98%E5%8F%B7%22%2C%22%E7%A9%BA%E7%99%BD%22%5D%7D%2C%7B%22surface%22%3A%22%E3%81%86%22%2C%22pos%22%3A10%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%22626%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E6%84%9F%E5%8B%95%E8%A9%9E%22%5D%7D%2C%7B%22surface%22%3A%22%EF%BD%90%22%2C%22pos%22%3A11%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%224432%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E8%A8%98%E5%8F%B7%22%2C%22%E3%82%A2%E3%83%AB%E3%83%95%E3%82%A1%E3%83%99%E3%83%83%E3%83%88%22%5D%7D%5D
