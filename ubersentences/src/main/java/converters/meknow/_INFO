HOW TO REMOVE TITLES IN MP3 FILES
----------------------

eyeD3 --remove-all fileName
Or run for all in folder.
eyeD3 --remove-all *


Goals:
1. Download all sentences as MP3.
    - File names are sentences themselves.
    - Each level has it own folder.
    - Sentence number as prefix for filename would be nice. For sorting.
HOW:
    - Download all API data responses which they use to build the pages.
    - Make JS scraper for getting API URLs. Save with IDs for folders.
    - Then get all via JSoup.
    - Load JSONs via Java. Make list of objects which contain all data.
    - Make list with URLs only to download with wget.

2. Replace MP3s in Anki deck.
    - Export deck and make map with sentence + file name. Check if you have the old one. There are no focus words.

So we can download an ordered list of URLs to the MP3 files. We can match the line numbers with the sentence.

Pro-tip: Open all pages of a section at once. And execute the shit concurrently.

1. Click on all play buttons. Try lower delay. Chrome throws if too fast.
$('div.sentence-audio-container > span').each(function(i, value) {
    setTimeout(function(){
       value.click();
    },500 + ( i * 500 ));
})

2. Download .har file from network tab.

3. Write script to scrape sentences, with index number for each to match. Save as JSON.
var result = []
$('div.sentence-text > p.text > span').each(function(index, elem) {
	var obj = {
		index: index,
		sentence: elem.innerText
	}
	result.push(obj);
})
console.log(JSON.stringify(result));

4. Write Java program to match sentences and MP3 files, rename to full sentence so it's shown in the MP3 player.
   - You can technically export the Anki deck and replace the sentences there. Just match the sentence strings.
