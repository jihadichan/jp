"日本人はオモロいよね"	"Japanese Folks are Fun<br>The word オモロい (おもろい) is a shortened form of 面白い (おもしろい). It can be taken to mean interesting, fun or cool depending on the context."	"https://www.fluentu.com/blog/japanese/japanese-slang-phrases/"

"https://www.fluentin3months.com/japanese-slang/"
"ウザい"	"This is the short, slangy form of the adjective うるさい (urusai), which means to be “annoyingly noisy.” When it’s shortened to ウザイ, though, it takes on a bit of a stronger meaning like “what a pain” or “pain in the ass.” (Although not as rude as using that phrase in English.) It can also be used to describe someone gloomy, with an Eeyore-like personality from Winnie the Pooh.

"キモい"	"This one is short for 気持ち悪い (kimochi warui), which means something gives you a “bad feeling.” 気持ち悪い is often used to describe any kind of bad feeling, like feeling sick or sad.

"イケメン"	"イケメン is used to talk about good-looking men with a very specific style. They’re usually well dressed, intelligent, and slender, with husky voices and aloof personalities. Think of this as Japan’s version of “tall, dark, and handsome.”<br><br>It’s often used to talk about celebrities, but any man can be regarded as イケメン. It comes from the word ikeru for “cool” and menzu for the English-derived word for “men.”"	"https://www.fluentin3months.com/japanese-slang/"
"マジ"	"マジ or マジで (maji de) is used as an exclamation of “Seriously?!” or “For real?!” It comes from the word 真面目 (majime) which means “serious.”"	"https://www.fluentin3months.com/japanese-slang/"
"リア充"	"This is an interesting slang term because it acknowledges just how deep we’ve gone into the digital era. We don’t have a term like this in English! リア充 means is a portmanteau word for “real world”, リアルワールド (riaru wa-rudo), and “satisfied”, 充実 (juujitsu).<br><br>It’s used to describe people who would rather be out in the real world, enjoying life. Or, who are satisfied with their real life rather than an online persona.

"オッス！"	"If you want a greeting closest to “What’s up, dude?” or “Yo, man!”… Well, this is it. It’s a shortened form of the greeting おはようございます (Ohayou gozaimasu, “Good morning”). It’s kind of like surfer-speak, and it’s used by guys to greet each other.<br><br>"	"https://www.fluentin3months.com/japanese-slang/"
"半端ない"	"This one is used the same way やばい is. It means “insane,” “kickass,” “awesome,” or “outrageous.” The word hanpa itself means “halfway” or “unfinished.” Since it’s used in its negative form with nai, you’re saying something’s “not half-assed, it’s whole-assed.” And therefore, it’s amazing."	"https://www.fluentin3months.com/japanese-slang/"
"ムカつく"	"This one comes from the Japanese onomatopoeia phrase, ムカムカする (mukamuka suru), which means to get angry, to be pissed off. つく (tsuku) comes from 作る (tsukuru), “to make.” So this phrase is used to say something has made you pissed off, or irritated you.

"それな！"	"This means, “That!” or “Exactly!” It’s used like English slang when we agree with something someone said, and we simply reply with “This!” Meaning, we were thinking the same thing and 100% agree."	"https://www.fluentin3months.com/japanese-slang/"
"おつ"	"Short for お疲れ様でした (otsukaresama deshita), meaning “you worked hard” or “good job.” You can use it as a slangy goodbye."	"https://www.fluentin3months.com/japanese-slang/"
"ガチ"	"Used the same way as マジ, it means “seriously” or “for real.”"	"https://www.fluentin3months.com/japanese-slang/"

"ずるい"	"This one means “sly” or “sneaky,” but it can also be used as an exclamation like “You suck!” It expresses both disgust and admiration for someone’s sneaky behavior.

"微妙"	"Bimyou means “questionable,” “iffy,” or even “kind of sucks.” It’s somewhere between まあまあ (maa maa, “so-so”) and まずい (mazui, “disgusting”) or ひどい (hidoi, “awful”)."	"https://www.fluentin3months.com/japanese-slang/"
"ウケる"	"It means “that’s funny” or “hilarious.” It’s actually a verb, but it’s used more like “haha!” in English."	"https://www.fluentin3months.com/japanese-slang/"
"ちょ"	"(cho): Very, totally. Used like とても (totemo)."	"https://www.fluentin3months.com/japanese-slang/"

"しょんどい "	"(shondoi): Tired, exhausted"	"https://www.fluentin3months.com/japanese-slang/"
"KY (ローマ字)"	"KY is an abbreviation for 空気読めない, which romanized reading “kuuki yomenai.” Thus, it became KY, written in English characters. It means someone “can’t read the air” or is oblivious to the mood of the room or another person."	"https://www.fluentin3months.com/japanese-slang/"
"なう"	"なう means exactly what it sounds like: “now.” It’s used online to say what someone is doing at that moment, especially on Twitter. An example: ランチなう (ranchi nau). “Eating lunch now.”"	"https://www.fluentin3months.com/japanese-slang/"
"ファボる"	"Another Twitterverse term, it means “favorite” and is used as a verb. So, you “favorite” a tweet, or “like” a post."	"https://www.fluentin3months.com/japanese-slang/"
"かまちょ"	"This is short for 構ってちょうだい (kamatte choudai), which means something like “Please let me know (if we can hang out)”. As a slang term, it’s posted online as a way to say “I’m bored, let’s chat” or “Talk to me.”"	"https://www.fluentin3months.com/japanese-slang/"
"W (ローマ字)"	"Yes, just “w.” It’s the Japanese equivalent of “lol” in English text slang. Why “w?” Because the word for “laugh” is 笑い (warai), so it starts with “w.” If you wanted to say “haha” though, you’d use the kanji itself, usually in parenthesis. Like this: (笑)"	"https://www.fluentin3months.com/japanese-slang/"
"ぐぐる"	"Like in English, “Google” has become a verb. To say you’re “googling it,” you use ぐぐる in Japanese. There’s also the text shorthand, GGRKS. It means ググレカス (gugurekasu), and means “Google it yourself, scum.” It’s a bit harsh, to say the least, but you’ll see it on the internet."	"https://www.fluentin3months.com/japanese-slang/"
"ドンマイ"	"This is another slangy phrase that comes from English, and it means “Don’t mind,” “No problem,” or “It was nothing.” You can use it in place of 何でもない (nande monai)."	"https://www.fluentin3months.com/japanese-slang/"
"KWSK (ローマ字)"	"Another common shorthand, it means “I need the details!” or “Details, please!” It comes from the Japanese phrase 詳しく (kuwashiku), so it’s the first letter of each syllable when romanized. It’s used to beg someone for all the deets."	"https://www.fluentin3months.com/japanese-slang/"
"WKTK (ローマ字)"	"This is used everywhere. It’s the abbreviation for ワクワクテカテカ (wakuwaku tekateka). That’s onomatopoeia for your heart is racing and you’re trembling with excitement. You can use this for anything and everything that you can’t wait for."	"https://www.fluentin3months.com/japanese-slang/"
"乙"	"This obscure kanji, which translates as “moth,” is now used as a shorthand for お疲れ様でした, which we talked about earlier. Why 乙? Because it’s read as おつ, which is the same slang term we covered above that means “you must be tired” or “thanks for your hard work.” You’ll see this as praise for someone online. Like when someone posts the answer to the clickbait title of an article in the comments to save you a click."	"https://www.fluentin3months.com/japanese-slang/"
"555 (ローマ字)"	"Another one based on how it sounds read aloud in Japanese. The number 5 in Japanese is ご (go). So when writing 555, you’re saying “Go, go, go!” It’s used in online gaming primarily. But it’s not the only number you’ll see pop up as internet slang! 888 is also used because it’s read はちはちはち (hachi hachi hachi), which is the onomatopoeia sound for clapping."	"https://www.fluentin3months.com/japanese-slang/"
"こｎ / んｐ / うｐ"	"Those three look like typos, don’t they? But they’re not typos at all! They’re abbreviated slang terms. こｎ is short for こんばんは, or “hello.” The romanized “n” is basically laziness because to get the ん character, you have to press the key an extra time. So they leave it as the romanized “n.”<br><br>As for the other two, んｐ is the same as English “np” which means “no problem.” And うp is short for “upload.”"	"https://www.fluentin3months.com/japanese-slang/"
"ダサい "	"(dasai): Lame, out of style, dorky, or sucky."	"https://www.fluentin3months.com/japanese-slang/"
"お前"	"(omae): A rude, blunt way to say “you.” It’s mostly used by men to other men as an insult because it literally means “The thing in front of me.” So, this person is so lowly they’re just this thing in your way. It’s sometimes used jokingly or lightheartedly though between friends.<br>"	"https://www.fluentin3months.com/japanese-slang/"
"われ "	"(ware): The same os お前, but more common in Kansai-ben."	"https://www.fluentin3months.com/japanese-slang/"
"やつ"	"(yatsu): Like calling someone “guy” or “bloke.” It can be used casually between friends, but it’s also a bit insulting because it’s something you don’t have much respect for and think of as “lower” than you."	"https://www.fluentin3months.com/japanese-slang/"
"ぶす "	"(busu): An ugly woman. It’s kind of used like “bitch” in English."	"https://www.fluentin3months.com/japanese-slang/"
