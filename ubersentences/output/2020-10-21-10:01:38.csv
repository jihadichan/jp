"あの人マジでチャラい。チャラチャラしないで。"	"That guy is seriously a player. Stop being so shallow.<br>- チャラい is an adjective to describe a person (usually men) as shallow and flirtatious. It usually refers to men who are players and constantly try to pick up girls. The word チャラい is used in different forms. One of the forms is チャラ男 (ちゃらお) which means the same as チャラい, but limited to only boys. The other form  is チャラチャラ(ちゃらちゃら), which comes from the sound that accessories make. Thus, the blings imply that one is shallow and superficial.<br>#<ruby>チャラい</ruby>:<ul><li>flashy; gaudy; wrapped in cheap flattery<div class=""info"">(I-adjective)</div></li><li class='np'><span class='ofrms'>Other Forms　<ruby>ちゃらい</ruby></span></li></ul><br>#<ruby>チャラ男<rt>チャラお</rt></ruby>:<ul><li>shallow playboy; frivolous lad; good-time Charlie<div class=""info"">(Noun)</div></li><li class='np'><span class='ofrms'>Other Forms　<ruby>ちゃら男<rt>ちゃらお</rt></ruby></span></li></ul><br>#<ruby>チャラチャラ</ruby>:<ul><li>coquettish; tawdry; flirty; flashy; flighty; jittery; superficial<div class=""info"">(Adverb taking the 'to' particle; Suru verb; Noun; Onomatopoeic or mimetic word)</div></li><li class='np'><span class='ofrms'>Other Forms　<ruby>ちゃらちゃら</ruby></span></li></ul>"	"https://www.fluentu.com/blog/japanese/japanese-slang-words-phrases/"	"anime1/1603310417980-あの人マジでチャラいチャラチャラしないで.mp3"	"%5B%7B%22surface%22%3A%22%E3%81%82%E3%81%AE%22%2C%22pos%22%3A0%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%2278%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%225240%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E9%80%A3%E4%BD%93%E8%A9%9E%22%5D%7D%2C%7B%22surface%22%3A%22%E4%BA%BA%22%2C%22reading%22%3A%22%E3%83%92%E3%83%88%22%2C%22pos%22%3A2%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%2268%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%2225%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E5%90%8D%E8%A9%9E%22%2C%22%E4%B8%80%E8%88%AC%22%5D%7D%2C%7B%22surface%22%3A%22%E3%83%9E%E3%82%B8%22%2C%22pos%22%3A3%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%22490%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E5%90%8D%E8%A9%9E%22%2C%22%E5%BD%A2%E5%AE%B9%E5%8B%95%E8%A9%9E%E8%AA%9E%E5%B9%B9%22%5D%7D%2C%7B%22surface%22%3A%22%E3%81%A7%22%2C%22baseForm%22%3A%22%E3%81%A0%22%2C%22conjugationForm%22%3A%22%E9%80%A3%E7%94%A8%E5%BD%A2%22%2C%22conjugationType%22%3A%22%E7%89%B9%E6%AE%8A%E3%83%BB%E3%83%80%22%2C%22pos%22%3A5%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%2292%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%2210%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E5%8A%A9%E5%8B%95%E8%A9%9E%22%5D%7D%2C%7B%22surface%22%3A%22%E3%83%81%E3%83%A3%E3%83%A9%22%2C%22pos%22%3A6%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%2210008%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E5%90%8D%E8%A9%9E%22%2C%22%E5%9B%BA%E6%9C%89%E5%90%8D%E8%A9%9E%22%2C%22%E4%BA%BA%E5%90%8D%22%2C%22%E4%B8%80%E8%88%AC%22%5D%7D%2C%7B%22surface%22%3A%22%E3%81%84%22%2C%22pos%22%3A9%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%22167%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E5%90%8D%E8%A9%9E%22%2C%22%E4%B8%80%E8%88%AC%22%5D%7D%2C%7B%22surface%22%3A%22%E3%80%82%22%2C%22pos%22%3A10%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E8%A8%98%E5%8F%B7%22%2C%22%E5%8F%A5%E7%82%B9%22%5D%7D%2C%7B%22surface%22%3A%22%E3%83%81%E3%83%A3%E3%83%A9%E3%83%81%E3%83%A3%E3%83%A9%22%2C%22pos%22%3A11%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E5%90%8D%E8%A9%9E%22%2C%22%E3%82%B5%E5%A4%89%E6%8E%A5%E7%B6%9A%22%5D%7D%2C%7B%22surface%22%3A%22%E3%81%97%22%2C%22baseForm%22%3A%22%E3%81%99%E3%82%8B%22%2C%22conjugationForm%22%3A%22%E6%9C%AA%E7%84%B6%E5%BD%A2%22%2C%22conjugationType%22%3A%22%E3%82%B5%E5%A4%89%E3%83%BB%E3%82%B9%E3%83%AB%22%2C%22pos%22%3A17%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%229%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%223%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E5%8B%95%E8%A9%9E%22%2C%22%E8%87%AA%E7%AB%8B%22%5D%7D%2C%7B%22surface%22%3A%22%E3%81%AA%E3%81%84%22%2C%22conjugationForm%22%3A%22%E9%80%A3%E7%94%A8%E3%83%87%E6%8E%A5%E7%B6%9A%22%2C%22conjugationType%22%3A%22%E7%89%B9%E6%AE%8A%E3%83%BB%E3%83%8A%E3%82%A4%22%2C%22pos%22%3A18%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%2214%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%226815%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E5%8A%A9%E5%8B%95%E8%A9%9E%22%5D%7D%2C%7B%22surface%22%3A%22%E3%81%A7%22%2C%22pos%22%3A20%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%2213%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%229%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E5%8A%A9%E8%A9%9E%22%2C%22%E6%8E%A5%E7%B6%9A%E5%8A%A9%E8%A9%9E%22%5D%7D%2C%7B%22surface%22%3A%22%E3%80%82%22%2C%22pos%22%3A21%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E8%A8%98%E5%8F%B7%22%2C%22%E5%8F%A5%E7%82%B9%22%5D%7D%5D"
"別れよう。お前重すぎる。/ テストの事考えたら、気が重くなった。"	"Let’s break up. You’re too much for me. / Thinking about test made me feel depressed.<br>- 重い literally means heavy and can be used in two different ways. The first way is to describe a person in a relationship. It is a negative word and connotes that this person is simply “too much” – whether that means s/he is constantly complaining, demanding, expecting too much or is obsessive. <br>- The second way to use 重い is when you describe something (a situation, feeling, words) as serious, uncomfortable, or depressing.<br>#<ruby>気が重い<rt>きがおもい</rt></ruby>:<ul><li>depressed; bummed out; down; heavy-hearted;

"555 (ローマ字)"	"Another one based on how it sounds read aloud in Japanese. The number 5 in Japanese is ご (go). So when writing 555, you’re saying “Go, go, go!” It’s used in online gaming primarily. But it’s not the only number you’ll see pop up as internet slang! 888 is also used because it’s read はちはちはち (hachi hachi hachi), which is the onomatopoeia sound for clapping."

"こｎ / んｐ / うｐ"	"Those three look like typos, don’t they? But they’re not typos at all!

So they leave it as the romanized “n.”<br><br>As for the other two, んｐ is the same as English “np” which means “no problem.” And うp is short for “upload.”"	"https://www.fluentin3months.com/japanese-slang/"	"anime1/1603310417985-こｎんｐうｐ.mp3"	"%5B%7B%22surface%22%3A%22%E3%81%93%22%2C%22pos%22%3A0%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%221497%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E5%90%8D%E8%A9%9E%22%2C%22%E4%B8%80%E8%88%AC%22%5D%7D%2C%7B%22surface%22%3A%22%EF%BD%8E%22%2C%22pos%22%3A1%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E8%A8%98%E5%8F%B7%22%2C%22%E3%82%A2%E3%83%AB%E3%83%95%E3%82%A1%E3%83%99%E3%83%83%E3%83%88%22%5D%7D%2C%7B%22surface%22%3A%22+%22%2C%22pos%22%3A2%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E8%A8%98%E5%8F%B7%22%2C%22%E7%A9%BA%E7%99%BD%22%5D%7D%2C%7B%22surface%22%3A%22%2F%22%2C%22pos%22%3A3%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E5%90%8D%E8%A9%9E%22%2C%22%E3%82%B5%E5%A4%89%E6%8E%A5%E7%B6%9A%22%5D%7D%2C%7B%22surface%22%3A%22+%22%2C%22pos%22%3A4%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E8%A8%98%E5%8F%B7%22%2C%22%E7%A9%BA%E7%99%BD%22%5D%7D%2C%7B%22surface%22%3A%22%E3%82%93%22%2C%22pos%22%3A5%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%2220%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%222394%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E5%90%8D%E8%A9%9E%22%2C%22%E9%9D%9E%E8%87%AA%E7%AB%8B%22%2C%22%E4%B8%80%E8%88%AC%22%5D%7D%2C%7B%22surface%22%3A%22%EF%BD%90%22%2C%22pos%22%3A6%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%224432%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E8%A8%98%E5%8F%B7%22%2C%22%E3%82%A2%E3%83%AB%E3%83%95%E3%82%A1%E3%83%99%E3%83%83%E3%83%88%22%5D%7D%2C%7B%22surface%22%3A%22+%22%2C%22pos%22%3A7%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E8%A8%98%E5%8F%B7%22%2C%22%E7%A9%BA%E7%99%BD%22%5D%7D%2C%7B%22surface%22%3A%22%2F%22%2C%22pos%22%3A8%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E5%90%8D%E8%A9%9E%22%2C%22%E3%82%B5%E5%A4%89%E6%8E%A5%E7%B6%9A%22%5D%7D%2C%7B%22surface%22%3A%22+%22%2C%22pos%22%3A9%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E8%A8%98%E5%8F%B7%22%2C%22%E7%A9%BA%E7%99%BD%22%5D%7D%2C%7B%22surface%22%3A%22%E3%81%86%22%2C%22pos%22%3A10%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%22626%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E6%84%9F%E5%8B%95%E8%A9%9E%22%5D%7D%2C%7B%22surface%22%3A%22%EF%BD%90%22%2C%22pos%22%3A11%2C%22freqNF%22%3A%224432%22%2C%22freqWK%22%3A%2299999%22%2C%22partsOfSpeech%22%3A%5B%22%E8%A8%98%E5%8F%B7%22%2C%22%E3%82%A2%E3%83%AB%E3%83%95%E3%82%A1%E3%83%99%E3%83%83%E3%83%88%22%5D%7D%5D"
